1,,Took the time to do some meal prep last night (experimented and ended up with a very cheesy alfredo pasta!),I spent time before work to do an easy 20-minute yoga flow since I’ve been spending a lot of time sitting at my desk and I am trying to get back into a routine for exercise!,Took a nap before work since my team this week was part of the first subteam.,Called a friend who happened to be on her lunch break since time zone differences often make finding time difficult.,Took a walk outside to take in some of the rare sun that was shining!,,Had a very busy weekend with my sister visiting town so I've decided to take today to catch up on things I'm behind in and to take a nap.,Spent some time on the phone catching up with my best friend during her lunch break. Since we are both in grad school on opposite ends of the country it can be difficult to find time to virtually spend time together so we take what little time we can!,Gave myself time to lie down on the couch and mindlessly scroll through social media and catch up on what my friends have been up to!,"Took a nap after class and ended up sleeping too long, but it was much needed.",Set aside and spent some time at night after studying to decompress by watching an episode of a show I’ve been saving. ,,"The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has had a positive effect on me. While I am fairly good at finding pockets of time for self-care myself, class sessions such as the mentor team discussions provided a space for me to engage in something I normally wouldn’t think to do, such as introducing me to new games to play in a group setting. This in particular is enjoyable in that I get to socialize with classmates I don’t normally extensively converse or hang out with.","During my gap years I gained a lot of insight around recognizing what kind of self-care I need at the moment which is how I chose between the options presented on the Choice Board. Influencing my decision was what was happening around me. If I was feeling overwhelmed between school and work I was more likely to rest and take some time alone, but on the days I had more energy I’d try to reach out and connect with others.","I believe self-care to be really important in living a healthy and balanced lifestyle, so having time to spend on self-care built into my schedule helped to ease some of my stress for at least the day."
2,,1. Select one of the activities that resonates with you: Rest/Relax 2. Document your participation: I decided to spend my 20 minutes of self-care by relaxing and listening to music.,"One of the activities that I chose from the Choice Board was relax. I find cleaning and organizing to be relaxing and a good stress reliever for me, so I decided to organize my room, file away emails and documents on my computer all while listening to music. I think that doing this helps me feel like I have my life somewhat put together and it allows me to be more productive with my work when I'm sitting in a clean space!","One of the activities that I chose for self-care was social connectedness. I was missing my older brother and his wife since they moved out of the family home, so I drove up to Marysville to visit and spend some time with them. It was nice because I hadn't seen them in a while.","For my self care, I went on a walk and listened to music!",One of the activities that I chose for health/wellness was rest and relax. I spent time watching TV with my parents. We watched a documentary on time travel and black holes. It was really interesting! ,,"I decided to spend my self care time by going on a run. I try to either go on runs or walks at least every other day if not daily. I find that running helps me release stress and frustration. Not only that, but it's also good for my health, so it's a win-win!","For my self care, I decided to find new music to listen to! I find listening to music to be very relaxing and it also helps motivate me to get things done.",I went on a run!,I watched TV with my dad!,"I painted my nails! This is something I really enjoy doing but haven't done since last year, so I'm happy that I was able to find some time to do this.",,The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care really helped me to spend time doing what I enjoy and having class time devoted to this made me realize how important self-care is to ensure success in my personal and professional life. I really appreciate the mentor team discussions because it makes me realize that I’m not alone and that I have the support from my mentor and classmates to help me do well in the program. ,"The way I decided which self-care to choose was based on how much time I had and the simplicity of the activity. If I had more time, I would choose to create something, such as working on a painting. If I had less time, I would choose exercise or hanging out with my family. If I had no time at all, I would choose to listen to music while doing homework or running errands.",The time spent on my choice of self-care allowed me to relax my mind and step away from work and school responsibilities for a short time.
3,,"Today, I cooked myself lunch and it was delicious! ",I took a walk around campus with my roommate to get some exercise and fresh air,I listened to some of my favorite artists while cooking ,"Today, I spent my break eating good food and watching an episode of Ozark!","Today, I spent some of my time watching a show on Netflix with my roommate. It was nice being able to spend some quality time with her.",,I took the time to finish building my baby Yoda lego statue while playing my favorite artists videos on Youtube in the background. ,I took the time to reach out and talk to one of my close friends back home because it had been a while since I talked to her one on one. It was nice catching up with her for a bit. ,This week I spent at least 20 minutes reading a book that I had found online as a break from studying. ,This week I spent about an hour getting dinner with my friends! Much needed study break! ,"This weekend, I went shopping with my friend and had dinner together. Then we also met up with other friends after and spent some quality time together!",,"The class time has reminded me on the importance of self care and that there are also people in the class who are going through the same thing and that none of us are alone. Additionally, it has shown me that even if it is not a long time to do the things that will help me relax, even a little bit of time helps and goes a long way. I think that during this time, I have done more self care than I usually do, especially mentally, which is nice. ",To decide on what to do it would mostly depend on my mood and what I felt like doing at the moment. Most of the time I would do the same things because its something I enjoyed and did not mind doing it multiple times. The weather also influenced my decision to some extent because if it was raining or too gloomy I would choose to do something more relaxing and not go outside. ,"The time spent on my choice of self care affected me in a positive way because it would be something I enjoyed and part of me would want to continue doing it, but I knew I had to get work done as well. But it was also a nice break from thing, sort of like a reset button to get me energized again. "

If I didn’t have any homework or exams coming up, then I would get lunch with my boyfriend or friends from undergraduate. ","It made me more relaxed and less stressed about the upcoming future such as exams and work. For that moment, I don’t have to think about school or work and only think about myself."
5,,I took a 20 minutes walk from the train station to my apartment. normally I usually take a bus. It was very refreshing.,"I met up with my friends for coffee and it was the best experience of the week. we connected, laughed, encouraged each other and reminisced our past. ",I soaked in the bathtub for an hour with relaxing music in the background. I was energized ❤️,I walked around the neighborhood for thirty minutes. The fresh air was amazing. Thankyou for always reminding us to do selfcare,I tried to using  peloton in our apartment building in preparation to riding my bike in summer and i did it for 15 minutes on first day and was out of breath. Today I did it for 35 minutes and the feeling was amazing. I have more energy! ,,"Yesterday was my birthday and my boyfriend planned a bowling night with my friend without telling me and i was so happy whe I saw all my friends there , in the middle of the week. We spent time together laughing and having fun and made memories. I felt loved and cared for. ",I am increasing my cardio work out in the apartment gym . Am lasting 30mins on the peloton. I do it monday Wednesday and Friday as self care. Thank you for this continuing progress in self care.!,I went to watch movie at ipic theatre in redmond for my friends birthday. It was very interesting because you order food and drinks as you are watching your favorite movie. I enjoyed the time with her and the service there. It felt like special selfcare treatment.,I took a 30 minutes walk in my new neighborhood and there’s a very beautiful creek with trees and birds chirping. Usually this is the background I put on when studying and now walking in it is so peaceful. And the weather is just perfect today! ,It was a nice day today and my friend and I took her kids to the park to play. It was amazing to be out like that after being unwell and in the house for a whole week. I feel energized and more focused.,,I have learnt to listen to people without interrupting them and have learnt to fight the urge to give a relating scene from my life. I try to put myself in the persons shoes and imagine how they would feel and how I would like to be treated if I were on the opposite side of the equation.,This is because I wanted to connect with myself more emotionally and un wide away from my computer,"This has been a lifeline because I always felt like I was wasting time if I walked away from my computer. I have realized that every time I hang out with my friends or ride the peloton, I come back very fresh on my computer and actually get more productive."
6,,"Currently, I have been way too stressed to focus on myself, especially because I was extremely sick last week and I could not submit any of my assignments, they all piled up for this week. However, last week I spend time focusing on getting rest, sleep, and hydrating so I can get better again.","The activity that resonates with me is Connecting to the environment, I spent the 20 mins of my time relaxing, staring out of the window while I drank coffee so I feel refreshed and I can get back to work and catch up on my assignments after class. ",I Focused on Resilience and growth mindset. I took this time to catch up some assignments such as  completing my CORE question for the week and doing the midpoint attestation. I did this while I had coffee and spend the rest of the time planning for the mentor meeting. I used this time to be productive so I can relieve some stress from my day.  ,"This week I focused on Resilience and coping skills Last week I had a very stressful midterm and WIP on Wednesday, I did not get enough sleep plus I work on weekends, today I slept in until 10:00 am. I spent some time just drinking coffee and staring outside the window, browsing through my phone so I can take that little time for myself before I start my work/studies.","Today, I focused on a growth mindset and rest relax. I am extremely stressed about the finals, and I have been too anxious to sleep at night. I used this time to catch up on sleep, I had a really good healthy breakfast. I am starting off the day with a healthy mindset so I can study the rest of the day without feeling burnt out or sleep-deprived. ",,"Resilience Coping Skills - I woke up and ate a really good breakfast, took a shower and I am ready to finish my work for the day and try to get as much work done as possible so I won't repeat what happened last quarter. ","I chose to practice reset and relax. This weekend I worked both days and after that I know I have a lot of work and I know I should study, but it was a long day at work. I just chose to hang out with my friends just relax and talk to them and catch up. I need to keep my mental health before anything and prevent myself from burning out. My goal for this quarter is to try my best to not get burnt out and give my mental health first priority. ",I sat on my balcony and just enjoyed my coffee for one hour in the warm weather. We rarely have warm weather and I really appreciate it when we do. ,"I focused on health and well-being. I utilized this time to drink coffee and relax. I have been feeling a little under the weather this week, I needed this time to relax and rejuvenate to get ready to work for the rest of the day.  ",n/a,,"Ans: Over the past three quarters the time for health and wellness has been so helpful and much required. 
I utilized it for many purposes. For nature connection, for development and growth, to rest and relax. It was a great break from the fast stress full and always busy life that we all have. ","Ans: My decisions for participating in the self-care module steamed from how I was feeling that day/week. I had a midterm and I needed to be productive, I used that time to catch up on assignments and I focused on the growth mindset aspect of the choice board.
When I was burnt out and I needed the break, I used it to enjoy my cup of coffee or cook breakfast/lunch, or any other activity that calmed me. ","Ans: Each quarter, I learned how to utilize my time better. Occasionally there are moments when I feel like I am doing something wrong when I take a little time for myself. I realized I need days where I do “nothing” productive and just relax as I do not want to be burnt out. This has a better impact on my mental health this quarter. I feel motivated to study for my midterms. "
7,,"Since we started school completely virtually, I feel like I have not been very active and felt a bit down. So, I have made changes to my day to day routine by starting the day with a quick run around my apartment building. I have also taken the time to socialize with friends and family so I don't feel so isolated all day long. ","Given that I have been sick for the past two weeks, I have chosen to complete the Self-connectedness activity. I wrote down on my planner a brief summary of changes that I plan to make this quarter to improve my health and remind myself to take some time off throughout the week to go for a walk, exercise, or do an activity that I enjoy like playing basketball. ","Social connectedness:I felted like I needed a break from school today. A lot going on in my head and I felt like I haven't been very social lately because all I do is study. Today, I spent some time to FaceTime my grandmother and a few other family/friends just to have a nice conversation. I also asked a friend if they wanted to go out and have lunch and maybe get a drink while watching sports. I felt like i really needed it since the quarter has been a bit of a struggle. ",Create: I spent some time learning how to cook a few different afghan dishes that my mom would make at home. I think it helped a lot just to relax and place my focus on something different other than school to release some stress. ,"For this assignment, I chose to do a rest and relax by doing meditation for about 20 to 30 minutes. I sat down and on empty dark room and closed my eyes for as long as possible and try to focus on relaxing muscles in different areas of the body. I used some of the techniques that was taught to us in the beginning of the pharmacy program.",,I spent some time this past few days going by the beach that is very close to my house. I think I have gotten so caught up with school and work that I have forgotten that there is a beach 5 minutes from where I currently live. I walk around for a bit and enjoy the sun before I get back to school work and I am planning on going later today as well. ,"Because I didn't have to drive this morning to get to school, I spent the time going to the gym that is near my house to get some exercise early in the day. I feel a bit relaxed and more focused.","Reflection: I spent a little bit of time reflecting on how school is going so far and how I can improve for the remainder of the quarter. As the last quarter of our first year approaches, the number of exams, projects, and other school related projects can be overwhelming. It is always good to plan ahead and try to stick to that plan to minimize stress. ",I spent some time reflecting on my progress as well as thinking about plans for the summer to expand my knowledge and expertise in the field of pharmacy. Having a set plan to put in motion once summer starts has help alleviate some of the stress I have built about how to maximize my summer break. ,I walked for about 15-20 minutes around the neighborhood to help reduce stress and increase mental focus. ,,The mentor team sessions have been the most effective way for me to reflect on ways to improve my skills or to reflect on my progress as a future practitioner. In addition to having a good mindset to improve my skills in areas of compassion and growth as an individual.,"I used to spend a lot of time outdoors and always took the time to connect with nature. I found this very relaxing and it develop to be a coping mechanism for me. However, the weather in Seattle is not always good to spend time out in nature, so I have learned to plan when the sunny days are ahead of time to make plans to go for a walk at the park, go for a hike, or spend some time by the beach.",My choices of self-care has definitely helped improve my mood and overall wellbeing by making connections with my environment or resting to catch up on sleep. 
8,,I was having a really hard week and I met up with a friend for a walk on the Quad and I felt a lot better afterwards ,I started going to therapy this week! It was just the first session (my first session ever) but I am very hopeful.,I had improv rehearsal and it was the first time this quarter where everyone was present ,I'm getting lunch with my  dad!,I took some time to write a journal entry. At the start of fall quarter I was journaling every night but fell off of it as things got hectic- I'm trying to be on top of it again ,,I cleaned my room ,I went to Trader Joes!,"I've been struggling with anxiety lately, which is not something I've ever had to deal with in my life before. When we first started keeping track of wellness activities, I had just begun going to therapy. I went every week, and then every other week and now I am down to as needed because in a lot of ways my mental health has improved since the beginning of Winter quarter. Unfortunately constant anxiety has cropped up as a new symptom in the past few weeks and I'm thinking I may need more support than just talk therapy. My mom is on an insurance plan through her work and since I am still included on her insurance, I thankfully have access to some free psychiatry and life-coach resources. I took time to research those options and am currently finding time in my schedule to set up a session",Finished reading a really good book called The Midnight Library ,n/a,,"I appreciated being allowed the time to take care of ourselves. It enhanced the feeling that the professors are mindful of our wellbeings. I didn’t find myself going out of my way to do a self care activity for the assignment, but I do think the checking in with myself each day to ask if I had been taking care of myself was very beneficial. ","Most often, I would say I participated task in the categories: environmental in cleaning my space, physical in exercising, and social in meeting up with friends. I chose my activity based on my needs in the moment and the amount of time I was able to put into the task also affected my decision. ","I was very appreciative that the time to do the activity was built into class time. In this way, it wasn’t really an option to claim that we didn’t have time for self care. Checking in with myself to see how I was taking care of myself always felt nice. "

Also, playing some type of game in breakout rooms after class during the off week from the WIP site was pretty fun.",Deciding on the different modules just depened on how many assignments I had to complete that week and based off that I would pick whatever was the most convenient. ,It positively affected me and gave some time to relax or do something that got me away from schoolwork.
10,,"For my self-care, I decided to FaceTime a friend to catch up and experience social interaction.",I started a new Netflix show to balance my study-relaxation!,"Since the weather has been pretty nice, I got coffee and took a walk!",I walked to class and took in the scenery.,This week I worked out at the IMA for 1 hour.,,"I spent Saturday night with my best friend from high school, Erin. We caught up and enjoyed delicious mocktails while watching Bridgerton.","After a good conversation about naps, I remembered that I took many naps this week in between my study sessions to keep my sanity and mental health in check. Caught some good zzzz's!","For my wellness self-care, I am documenting our team session today. I really enjoyed Jen's paracord activity and found myself really relaxed (after I got out my initial frustration haha).","For my wellness, I decided to read for 20 minutes. I haven't sat down and enjoyed a book in a while, so it was nice getting get through a couple chapters before starting the school grind again!",I sat outside today near the water at South Canpus Center. Good views for dead week!,,"Mentor team meetings started last quarter and I have really appreciated them. Although, I don’t always have much to say, I liked being in a smaller group with people who I don’t talk to regularly. This brought in a lot of different ideas and perspectives. I remember there was a lesson on habits and another one on napping that gave me some new ideas on how I could improve my health and wellness. ","It depended on the week. Generally, I’m an introverted person and I prefer to have self-care time to myself. Most weeks, I took a nap or went on a walk. Sometimes, I choose to connecting with friends as myself care when I haven’t seen them in a while.","It has made me more productive! Before, I would study all day, every day. However, making the time for myself and mental health, it has been a lot easier to stay focused and engaged during studying!"

I also always let him play with the other dogs we encountered, and it warms my heart to see him playing and waving fun with other dog friends.",I love connecting with the environment by enjoying the sunset. My husband and I took a half hour walk through Magnuson Park at sunset and I was able to take lots of good photos of the sun setting on rainier.,"I have been biking 4 miles to school and back every in person day.

12,,"I went to the gym multiple times, specifically I have been lifting weights and stationary cycling.  I had a long lapse away from the gym but I really enjoy going because it gives me a time where the only focus is my health and nothing else, which is something I sometimes forget.  I usually spend about an hour to an hour and a half there.  ","I read a book for the first time in awhile that wasn't a technical book or related to pharmacy. The book was rather short and was not my favorite by any means, but it was engaging enough that I finished it. It was a nice mental break to just be fully lost in a story for awhile rather then focusing on stressors. I love to books and that love has been put on the sidelines by school, and it was great to reignite that passion.  I don't have time to do it all that much, but it was truly great to read just for the sake of reading and was a good way to relax. ","The other day I was stressed and tired and felt like I was rereading the same thing over and over and not absorbing it. So I took a break, had a snack, and then decided to draw for a little bit.  I used to draw quite frequently, it was one of my passions when I was younger but something I don't indulge in often anymore.  It was nice to spend a good 30 minutes drawing and letting myself just zone into this one thing that has always allowed me to clear my mind.  ","I went hiking with a good friend of mine and my dog.  We hiked up a trail that is commonly used for cross country skiing and snowshoeing.  The snow was compact enough that we did not need snowshoes though.  We hiked up about four miles with sleds, looking like lunatics, and then sledded all the way down.  It was ridiculously fun, sledding down four miles, we were giggling like kids the whole way. It was a really nice break.","This last weekend I went to a concert with my fiancé. Before the pandemic we went to a couple concerts a month, and it is something we have really missed. t was so nice to get out and see live music.  The concert was for a local band's album release weekend, always good to support local talent as well.  The band is called The Dip, they have a funk/soul/pop kind of feel and are super fun. It was really enjoyable. ",,"For my self wellness my friend Katy and I went and got coffee and planned out some of the backpacking trips we want to do this summer. We specifically laid out our plans for a 5 day trip in Olympic National Park right after finals, and I am really looking forward to it, I have had a really good time backpacking the Olympics in the past. ","I took a walk outside. A long one. Up most of Mt. Saint Helens. My friend, my fiancé, and I went to climb Mt. Saint Helens last weekend.  The weather was a little variable so we knew that we may not make it to the top, but figured we would give it a whirl anyways.  We got a bit over halfway up when we started entering a snowstorm that had settled itself at the top of the mountain and wasn't budging.  Visibility was getting poor and the wind was beating us a up a bit, so we decided that it wasn't in the cards for the day and turned around and headed down.  I am glad we did because the weather got worse from there.  It was still a fun day out in the snow enjoying nature with some of my favorite people, we will just have to try again in May.  ",My fiancé and I went and got dinner with my dad and my brother for their birthdays (both are in late April). It was really fun to catch up with them and celebrate together. ,I took some time to draw. It was nice to break out of the pharmacy student mindset and use my creative side that has been a little neglected over the school year.,"Last week my D&D group was finally able to sync up schedules and meet up for a session (for whoever has to read this and doesn't know, D&D is Dungeons and Dragons, a dorky but fun table top role-playing game). We have been playing this campaign for almost a year, but have had to play a lot less with me in pharmacy school and one guy in nursing school. Most are healthcare workers from my old job in the ER, it's a great group. It is so much fun, a great way to have some drinks, some laughs, and follow/create a crazy story. I needed the break more then I thought.",,"I think my favorite parts have been the mentor team discussions. I don’t live close, so while I have made some friends I am still a little bit more distant, having these team discussions helped me feel less alone and share with my peers. It was nice since I feel like my other family and friends do not fully understand everything I am doing, and I think just not feeling alone was more important to me then I would have thought.","Honestly the weather influenced my decision most of the time. I insist that I must be solar powered, so whenever the sun was out, I was determined to be outside. I also have a deep love for the outdoors, so it makes it an easy choice for me. Sometimes it happened to be more of a social occasion then others, but 9 times out off 10 I would just naturally choose something that would involve connecting to nature. ","I am not always very good at taking time for myself, and I think that having to put some of that time aside to do something that was just for me (whether it involved other people or not) was an important piece of staying centered. "
13,,I listened to some relaxing music today. It was an ambient Harry Potter remix soundtrack and it felt nostalgic and comforting!,"Today I had some social interaction with students in my PHRMPR 512 class after our session was over. My group and I stayed on Zoom talking about classes, work, and other random things for about 40-45 minutes. The social interaction helped me de-stress. I was also able to talk to students who I have not yet been able to really talk to and make a connection! I found this activity relaxing as we could talk about things we were stressed about and things we were looking forward to and laugh together! ","Today I needed to get some pens to take notes and I decided to go to Daiso which is only about a mile away. Instead of driving, I decided to walk and get some fresh air and I found it helps with my mental health and overall feeling healthier. I was able to really look around and see what other places are around me which I normally would not have noticed if I were to drive! ","Today I went on another walk. I needed to get some hair oil and instead of driving, I decided to walk about 20-25 minutes each way. It felt nice getting some fresh air in the morning. I also do a lot of self-care in the form of skincare and I want to start doing more hair care. When I take care of myself physically in these forms I feel more put together and generally better about myself. Walking is another way I can physically help myself. I think doing these physical activities like walking, skincare, and hair care reflect onto my mental health as well in a positive manner! I also wanted to thank the 512 teaching team for doing this wellness self-care documentation. It reminds me to take care of myself and take a break from studying or stressing! Thank you!","Today, I decided to make a homemade meal. I feel as though I have been eating out a lot more and generally not eating healthy because I don't have much time to do anything besides catch up and study. It was nice to finally give myself time to cook as I do enjoy coming up with new recipes and seeing where my hands and tastebuds take me! ",,"Today I spent some time reading ""The Vanishing Half"" by Brit Bennett. I have been meaning to read this book since I found it on Barack Obama's favorite books of 2020 list and I finally decided to dedicate some time to read a few chapters!",This morning I bought myself some flowers to decorate my room. I put them on my study table because the colors truly liven up the space and whenever I need a break from studying I can look up and the flowers are there! I'm thinking about getting some plants for my place as well as the greenery looks pretty and calming.  ,I had more unconventional self-care activity today. I did some retail therapy by going to UVillage and got a candle because my candle supply was running low. I like to light a candle when I'm studying because it makes it more cozy and the nice smell temporarily distracts me from the stress from any exams! I suppose it's unconventional because I also want to save money but I also really wanted that candle!,Today I decided to start writing in my journal again. I find it calming and relaxing and I think it would be nice to have these writings I can look back on as I get older!,This morning I decided to walk to campus instead of taking the bus. The sun is out which made it so enjoyable and warm! I also remembered to take my allergy medication last night so I would not sneeze like crazy!,,"I have enjoyed having the space to discuss health and wellness and want to thank the entire teaching team for providing that opportunity. It allowed time to focus on myself mentally, emotionally, and physically. The mentor team discussions provided a space to talk to my classmates and sometimes enjoy activities like Kahoot, which provided a good change in pace. ","I tend to spend a lot of my time focusing on school, family, or friends. Therefore, I decided that this would be more of a time I would spend to do something that simply made me happy. That changed week to week and there were days that a walk would make me happy and other days where making a meal at home was perfect. I relied on letting myself do what I wanted to do in the moment instead of thinking about it too long and weighing my options. ","It allowed time in the middle of the week to kick back and relax or do something I wanted to do. Or during weeks with multiple exams, I was able to use the extra time to take care of myself and then catch up on studying. I am grateful for the extra time we were given to focus on ourselves and use it in the way we saw fit.  "

Si,This week I was able to take some more time and go on a longer hike to the Oyster Dome. ,This week I cooked up some tacos for my roommate and I.,"After an early morning shift at work, I took a nap to rest and recharge before studying this week. ",,"I have found that the mentor team discussions have been a great way to get to know my mentor and a handful of other classmates better. It has been great to hear from them about their hobbies, growth over the past year, and venting about school or WIP or anything. I feel that these have been a safe space to have fun for about 20 minutes every two weeks. With the other areas of discussing health and wellness, I feel I would rather have that time back to actually contribute to my own health and wellness, and possibly have asynchronous work instead to learn about those opportunities or why taking care of our wellbeing first is important. Those sessions were interesting, but with our limited schedule, I would prefer to learn on my own time. ","Often, I choose what I have often done for my own wellbeing. Connecting with nature is often my preferred way to reset, and I often did this through walking or hiking throughout the quarter. I felt that this has been working for me for a long time, and it has continued to do so through the last 3 quarters. ",I have always considered my wellbeing to be very important even as I am extremely busy in other areas of my life. Participating in this self-care was not outside of my usual routine and continued to allow me to not become overwhelmed or forget the larger picture of life that may be difficult to see as I am in pharmacy school.

(Heating up the food mostly),Cooked some wings for lunch (30 minutes),I heated up some rice for lunch and ate for 30 minutes. ,Regrouped myself and spent 15 minutes organizing everything that I need to do for the next 2 weeks. ,,It helped me be aware of the other things going on in life. Whether it’s a daily reminder to exercise or cook a meal for myself. The class time devoted to health and wellness overall made my quarter less stressful.,"My decisions during the self-care activity was generally based on my food and hunger. Sometimes my workload will dictate what I do as well. If I have a lot of homework, I will take a shorter walk or cook something easy to make.","It overall de-stressed my day, helped me dial back and look at my life as a whole."
16,,"I took a workout class to better my health, strengthen my immune system, and clear my mind. ","This has been a stressful school week with our first midterm coming up, so I have been sleep deprived and stressed. I spent my self-care time by relaxing and taking a much-needed nap to reset my mindset in order to continue studying. I really enjoyed the discussion on growth mindset. I do believe that it is important to be open-minded and to approach situations with no judgment. You would be surprised how much you can learn when you open your mind and heart to new ideas and new opportunities. ","For this week's self-care, I spent my time actually being able to cook a meal. Although this sounds like an easy task to complete everyday, I've actually haven't had the time to be able to even do something so simple. With having to go back to campus starting this week and trying to catch up with school, simple tasks like cooking a meal or even folding laundry has been quite difficult to complete. So I am grateful for any amount of extra time in the day to get things done.","For my self-care, I spent my time treating myself to some “me time.” It’s been a while since I’ve had time for myself so it was nice to do something for myself. In this time, I got my nails done because I love it when my nails are cute. It definitely puts me in a better mood! I do appreciate the extra time given to us to take care of ourselves. Even if it’s an extra 1 to 2 hours, can really make a difference. ","For my health and wellness this week, I chose to spend my extra free time by going to church. Yesterday just so happened to fall on Ash Wednesday. I really appreciated having the time to go to church seeing how my busy school schedule hasn’t given me the time do so over the quarter. It was comforting to reconnect with my faith again. ",,"Seeing how there is a little bit more free time in the beginning of the quarter, I was able to go out and enjoy the sunshine for a bit. I went to explore Golden Gardens Park, since I've never been there before. I got to walk around and enjoy the nature. It was really beautiful.","Yesterday, I took a break from studying to try a new restaurant for Seattle Restaurant Week. I went to eat at a Brazilian restaurant which turned out to be very yummy. Today, I will spend my reserved time catching up with my studies. ",I’ve been really stressed lately due to midterms so I find stress-relief in working out. I took a workout class this morning that was team-based and it was a lot of fun working with others to complete a goal. It was a great stress-relieving break from studying.,"I took some time away from studying last night to go for a walk with my boyfriend to our local Italian restaurant. The weather was nice and the sun was out, so it was very refreshing to get out of the house for dinner. There was definitely a lot of bread involved.",I spent my extra time getting in a nice workout followed by a relaxing nap. Thank you for prioritizing self-care in our busy schedules. ,,This class time has been absolutely vital in helping me practice effective self-care and wellness. The topics we discuss in class are imperative in aiding mental health. I am also very grateful for this time to reevaluate and assess my wellbeing in order to do well in school. It is important to take care of myself so that I may perform at my best.,"When choosing how to participate in self-care, it was more about listening to my body and what I need to take care of myself, whether that be taking a well-deserved nap, taking a workout class, or even going out for lunch with a friend. Having the extra time to do these things has affected my mental health in a very positive way. Along with having the time to do these things, it also has benefited my studying by giving me extra time to catch up with any material that I may have been falling behind in. ",The time spent on self-care has affected my mental health in a very positive way. I was able to focus on things that benefited me physically and mentally such as going for a workout or even catching up with some friends. These are simple things that I normally wouldn’t find the time to do but having this extra time to take care of myself has been extremely helpful.

Messy room, messy mind!",I visited the dunes near Moses Lake with my friends!,,"A lot of the times I come in stressed from other classes and just waiting for the session to be over so I can go back to studying, but I have never regretted any of our discussions in class. If anything, it was a well-needed break from everything (the break I could not give myself). Also the fact that the class was scheduled to last to 2pm but ended earlier was really helpful because I did not feel like I was behind when I chose to give myself some more time after everything ended to take care of myself.  That feeling of being supposed to be in class but not actually being in class or missing anything helped, if that makes sense!","At the beginning of the fall quarter, I was very stringent on myself and mostly cut off communications with friends so I can fulfill my schedule. This quarter I decided to, in an effort to participate in self care as part of our class, set aside some time every night to talk to a friend about anything that comes into our minds. The conversations are always endless, and I never regret them, and it is a nice break from my busy schedule. Other times, I could see when I am not productive because there is a dark cloud over my head,  and pull myself out to take a walk and grab a coffee, or spend some time with a friend. At night to wind down, I have started a skin care routine- my skin has always been perfectly fine with me washing it with water (and the skin care routine does not make much of a difference), but I physically feel like I am giving myself care. ","I noticed that I had a lot more motivation and a lot more time because I did not have to deal with the mental fatigue and got more things done. I am also better at being more aware of when I need some self-care. My skin also feels a little softer too from the skincare routine, which is a nice side effect. "

It just makes me feel cared for that my instructors understand that pharmacy school can be overwhelming and stressful to the students, and require that we do self care. Thank you all so much, it is much appreciated.","Bi-weekly when dedicating my time for self-care the choice of assessing emotional wellness, connecting to the environment, resting/relaxing, or creating is sporadic. I never force myself to rest, go for a walk, or draw if I do not want to. The activity depends on my mood and is determined from there.","It made me take a step back from being overwhelmed and stressed from school, and reminded me that I need to take care of myself."

I notice I don’t feel as anxious about meeting deadlines as much and more relaxed about schoolwork overall. ","I chose based on how I was feeling that day or what deadlines I had to meet soon. If I didn’t have an assignment that was due at the end of week or that I could push until later, I would do something that took longer, such as a walk or making a meal. If I had more immediate deadlines, then I would do something simple like relaxing or listening to music. ","I felt like my thinking was “clearer” and I was able to plan and prioritize what I needed to get done. I was also not as anxious about schoolwork and didn’t get stressed at deadlines as much. Overall, it had a positive impact on me. I think it has also reflected in my schoolwork this quarter. "

The class time also reminds me to take care my health and find time to spend with my family and my love one. The talking in mentor team discussions help us to know more about our classmates and shared our life experience which I think it’s very helpful especially during this pandemic time. ,"I think the support wellbeing: choice board is the easiest thing to do but it’s also difficult to chose which one should I do because I only have a certain free time and I want to use it effectively. Sometime, I have to prioritize my choices each week depends on the materials that I have to study.

For example, I sometime have to choose between taking a 20 minutes nap or go exercise for 20 minutes. It sounds very simple but it has a bit effect to my daily tasks.

Recently, I decided to try something new which I could do without going out in case it's raining, or when the weather is too cold to run or walk.

27,,"I burned some sage to clear my energy as well as the energy in my space. Then, I proceeded to do a grounding exercise that was taught to me by my teacher Cindy. I used to practice grounding at least once a week when I lived in Chicago, plus I also attended sound mediation. Since I arrived in Washington, I have not done either. So this was amazing and greatly needed. It felt wonderful to release, reconnect, and set an intention to my day. [photo of burning sage]","Today, I decided to cook a meal, and I made a mushroom-cheese egg scramble, topped with green salsa. It only took 10 minutes to make (maybe less), but since I still have a lot of studying to do today, it was a good idea to have a meal to hold me through the rest of the afternoon. Usually for breakfast, I have coffee and lots of water. It was nice to be able to have a meal before sitting down to continue with school work.  I enjoy cooking and spending time in the kitchen. At the moment, school has been taking up a lot of my time, and my stress levels have significantly increased. This is affecting me a lot because I can feel my anxiety getting out of control, to the point where cooking is also becoming stressful. Spending more than half hour in the kitchen to clean and cook is not an option because there is so much studying and homework to be done. During the day I have to remind myself that it is ok to take a meal break. My first meal is usually sometime after noon. But, today we had a little break in class so I was able to take 20 minutes to make an egg-scramble.","For my self care this week, it took more than 20 minutes but I thought it was worth it, I cleaned and organized my kitchen. Having a clean and organized space helps me feel calm and relaxed. If my space is unorganized, it is like I can feel the chaos of the space. Cleaning and organizing even for a small amount of time helped my brain feel more relaxed before I started to study again. This actually benefits my brain and my apartment. ","I wish I could have stayed in bed a little longer, probably slept a little longer, but it was a good thing that I got up for class. During the hour for ‘Me’ time, I called home to check in on mom. She was happy because her sister was there and they were making cream of broccoli soup. I miss her and my dog too. At the same time, I made myself breakfast, something easy and fast that reminds me of my childhood. Eggs cooked with sliced wieners. And then you put ketchup on top. Chicago people take very much offense to putting ketchup on hotdogs, but they just don’t know what they are missing. After that, I made my bed and organized the kitchen. Then, I realized that self-care means the most basic care for living (food, clean, wash clothes, etc.). It made me laugh at myself, but at this point I will take what I can get, and I am super grateful to have had that hour because I feel mentally awake and ready to go about the rest of my day. Coffee also helps.","For self-care, this week I organized my apartment (it’s a studio so it’s not so much) and it felt great! There is this calming feeling when my surroundings are organized, it makes me happy, and it motivates me to study more. I did laundry and made sure everything was clean and hung in its respective place; my clothes are organized by color, it flows nicely and it’s pretty to look at, plus I know where everything is and it takes me less time to pick something to wear. I folded sweaters, stored shoes that I don’t wear often and left out the ones that I wear the most for school and work. This also helps because I have the minimum number of shoes available, which means less time spent looking for shoes. But, the one thing that made me really happy was rearranging my furniture. I feel like I tend to do this a lot, after a while something starts to feel off about the apartment, I move the furniture, and then everything is well in my world again. I kept thinking about my mom because we would help her rearrange the furniture as kids, and we did it quite often. I get it now. Been meaning to tell her that. My apartment is organized, but in my head, it’s not fully organized, so I am always looking for ways to improve things. For spring break, my plan is to organize the kitchen, put up some curtains, bring in some green plants, and scrub the kitchen floors (I sweep and clean but it feels like it needs a good scrubbing). It’s definitely not a trip to Cabo, but I know it’s going to make me so happy. ",,"For wellness, I organized and decluttered my closet. I feel a sense of relief when my environment is organized, visually it gives me peace, and the overwhelm I feel regardless of the source is alleviated. I know it sounds weird, but organizing makes me happy. Also, for some time I have been meaning to add plants to my apartment. I was missing some sort of greenery, seeing green plants and trees make me happy. That is the beautiful thing about living in Washington, there is so much green year-round, and even going for a drive outside the city to see nature gives me peace. I bought a small plant at Trader Joe’s and seeing the color green in my apartment lifts my spirits. So, I thought to myself, I need to get more greenery! The only nearest green I had was in my fridge – asparagus. I made asparagus into décor for my apartment. I do plan on eating the asparagus and in the mean time I can go check out more plants to buy. [photo of plant] [photo of asparagus ""plants"" in window]","For my health and wellness for this week, I changed the setting on my phone to “Do not disturb” during the night until 9am. I am not answering calls, texts, chats, email before 9am. I know it sounds weird, but I have been on my phone a lot more than usual this past week, because it is the only way to communicate with people back home. I was getting stressed out or I felt bad if I missed a call or text and I didn’t respond back right away. One text message that I got said, “Your response time is horrible you take so long to answer back”. That’s when I realized I was being manipulated emotionally to be present at times when I could not. And I remembered what Dr. Do said about boundaries in class last week too. Boundaries are still necessary even when we are trying to help those we love. I have been sleeping better the last two days, waking up with a clear mind makes a world of difference so I can be present here to continue my work in pharmacy school. ","For my health and wellness this week I took myself out for tacos. I know it doesn’t sound very exciting, but it just made my day. I haven’t had tacos in quite a while so I was way overdue. The place I go to is in Everett and it just fills me with beautiful memories. It is the first place my dad and I ate when we arrived to the Seattle area at the end of July 2021 (my dad drove with me from Chicago to Washington, then he flew back home). Food is comfort for us. Being somewhere new and so far away from home, it just made us so happy to have found a good taco place when we arrived. I always facetime my parents to show them my tacos! So, I guess it is more than tacos, it just makes me remember all the great memories that I made with my dad during our 4-day long road trip. Also, it reminds me how grateful I am to be where I am at today. Also, the fact that I can find the taco place without GPS is a win in my book! So yeah, tacos. Good stuff. [photo with caption: Favorite picture of my dad. He had never seen trees as tall as these. We found a Walmart in Everett, bought fishing poles, and went fishing!]","This week, I find myself in Chicago with my family. I was having anxiety about coming home because the family drama kept piling on, and it was even causing me to lose sleep over the past 2 weeks. Yet, I am such a lucky human to have friends who keep me sane and know how to reel me back in. Today’s story is about my amazing friend [name] and how he saves me every time I am in town. In November of last year, he took me to art therapy during a time when my soul was feeling unrest. This time around, he picked me up from O’Hare airport, took me out for chicken and waffles (he paid), drove me to my parent’s house, hauled my luggage inside their house, played with my dog, and had a nice visit with my mom. First and foremost, no one likes going to O’Hare, especially in the middle of the day, and he was happy to do it. Second, he doesn’t like to keep me waiting, so he was there early even though my flight was delayed. Third, chicken and waffles! Being able to spend the day with such an amazing friend gave me a wonderful and happy start to a very exhausting upcoming week. We didn’t talk about family, school, nor work. We just laughed a lot, and to be honest, that is all I needed. I am super lucky to have a friend like him. [photo of student and friend with caption: We love to go on walks. During the pandemic, we would walk in a cemetery on Sheridan Avenue early in the morning and follow the coywolves (coyote/wolf mix) that lived there. He is the only person who calls me [full name].]","Our PY1 year is coming to an end and I have a lot to be grateful for. I’m grateful for the sunshine, even on cloudy days, because I know the sun is still there. I am grateful for my apartment because it has come a long way from the days with an air mattress on the floor and a cardboard box table. The following are my top 5 things I am grateful for:
1. I am grateful that my parents are being extremely supportive. This was not the case at first because it was hard for them to have me so far away. Yet, with time they have come see how happy I am here in Washington, and that means the world to them. There are some days that my mom still struggles and misses me a lot, but then I ask her to come live here with me for a couple of weeks, and she decides she can wait until I come home again to visit. 
2. I am grateful for my friends, new and old. I have made amazing friends at school and outside of school that are also supportive, kind, and caring.
3. I am grateful that I have amazing professors who are understanding and compassionate. Some things have been challenging since I have moved to Seattle. The loss of my aunt in November, feeling alone and overwhelmed at time when I go back to Chicago, my mother’s health being unpredictable, the crazy demands of a Mexican federal and local government, my extended family falling apart due to changes my grams made to her will before she past away, Steven’s mental health, and my own mental health. So yes, I am so ever grateful to my professors for helping me get through all these things. And I am determined to one day move back to Chicago, and have a new sense of normal that does not involve so much drama.
4. I am grateful for the mountains that I get to see everyday because they lift me and make me smile.
5. Lastly, I am grateful for the amazing experiences and opportunities that I get to live everyday.",,"Honestly, I think there should be a whole class dedicated to health and wellness. It has been particularly useful, relaxing, and more than anything enjoyable. It has changed my mindset about how I care for myself, it is still an on-going process, yet it is a start. I like the mentor team discussions because I get to see how creative my classmates can be when it comes to health and wellness. Also, it is the one class where we can really open up and work on ourselves. There is an extreme amount of pressure in the road to becoming a future pharmacist, which can affect our mental, physical, and spiritual health. Part of me hopes that our pharmacy program also advocates for the well-being of its students. In the end, it will make us, the students, natural advocates for our patients as well.","My decision was based on what I needed at the time. Some days, I yearn for quiet spaces, slowing down a bit to enjoy being present in the now. This allows me to connect to a higher level of existence in this world, to think outside of myself and be thankful for the simple things that make life joyous. Other times, I join a study group because I enjoy the company of friends, and studying as a group really helps reinforce my learning. ","It was truly needed. I never thought how complicated/challenging my life was until I moved here. Complicated and challenging was my normal so I never saw it as complicated or challenging, because it was normal environment. Yet, I worked on myself to get through things as seamlessly as possible. Now, being here in pharmacy school in Seattle, working on my self-care and being removed from what used to be my norm has made me change how I look at challenging life situations that arise. I feel like I am no longer in the storm, rather I am outside looking in. And this has made a world of difference."
28,,I went to LA Fitness and exercised today.,I wrote in my phone journal for 20 minutes.,Went to LA fitness and did some weight lifting. ,"Once again, went to LA fitness to help take my mind off of school work! ",Went to LA fitness to relieve some stress ,,Went on a light walk around my neighborhood and looked at the cherry blossoms!,Took a nice relaxing drive to the beach and walked around. ,Went to my local gym after our class meeting.,Went to my local LA Fitness!,Went to my local gym in the nice sun! ,,I think that by having separate time that focuses on letting us take mental breaks have been very helpful. In a way it makes us take more time to consider about ourselves versus just going to class after class.  Having providers that care and ask about your day and overall how you are doing with class has made me feel more appreciated and welcomed. ,"For myself, choosing to exercise is something that I have known to help my mental well-being and my physical well-being. I have also been able to socialize with others at the gym which helps as well. This task has been the most natural for me and I plan to keep it up. ",My time spent on self-care feels very worthwhile. I feel like I am destressing while also being able to feel healthier and both of these overall make school less straining. 
29,,I went out to lunch with a friend who I haven't seen in about two years,I took a nap ,I grabbed coffee and had a chat with my mentor ,I went outside and enjoyed the sun ,I went out to lunch with my mentee ,,I went out to grab boba and went grocery shopping ,I took a nap after eating ,I took a nap ,I got lunch with my big [sibling from fraternity],I went to the gym ,,I think it allowed me to communicate with others and further developing my communication skills,Decision usually depends on whether I had made plans before and if my friends are free. If there are free I would most likely hang out with them during my self-care,"The time spent on my choice of self-care allowed me to regroup, gain more energy to focus on the other tasks I have on hand afterward. "
30,,I worked out at the gym for a couple hours to take care of myself. ,I spent an hour speaking to my therapist.,I reached out to my dad and chatted for a while,I went for a walk,I took a walk with my friend on a trail ,,I spoke with my brother over the phone and we caught up with each other. ,I spent some time at the gym to decompress from the week. ,I will be facetiming a friend. ,I will be working out at the gym and catching up on studying for the upcoming miderm.,I went to the gym today. ,,Having built in time dedicated to self care/things I need to take care of every other Wednesday was nice for me to take time for myself an away from schoolwork for a little while. ,"I usually chose how to participate in self-care depending on my schedule and what I needed in that moment. If I was feeling very tired from exams, I would be more likely to choose to rest, or if I hadn’t talked to a particular family member/friend in a while I would call them. ",It allowed me to regroup and be more prepared for the rest of the week and allowed me time to work on my personal relationships. 
31,,"Happy New Year 2022!  My goal in this year is trying to be in present as much as I can.  Taking good care of yourself is also a way to love yourself. 
I understand it is a real challenge to balance my academic life, professional life, and personal life at once and make time to do things I enjoy in my busy schedule.  
Today, the activity that I would like to choose is nurture connection; specifically, self-connectedness.  Journal: I love to spend some few minutes at the end of the day to write down all my thoughts and reflect my own self. Journal helps me to clear myself and understand myself more. So, I know what I need to improve, and questioning myself some questions like what are my weaknesses/strengths? what are my goals/purposes? why should I feel proud of myself?Write a letter to my future self: who I want to become, what I want to accomplish. What are the challenges that I want to overcome in the next week/month/year? What lessons that I want to give advice for my younger self and future self?
 ","Organizing the order of priority is a skill that I need to improve. It is important for me to organize my own life at the moment. 

Today, the activity that I would like to choose is nurture connection; specifically, self-connectedness. 
Firstly, I want to have a vision board which contains all my dreams and goals that I want to achieve in the next 4 years (2025- the year I will graduate from pharmacy school).  
Secondly, I will write a future letter for myself in 2025. In the letter, When I write this letter, I pretend that I already achieved all things I wish when I was young. For example, I will say that I am so proud of myself because I already finished the pharmacy school, now I’m officially become a real pharmacist which is a significant milestone in my career and my life. 
Thirdly, reflect on my journey. I will make a comparison between the reality (2025) and my vision board to see how much different. Writing down all the reason why I do not achieve the goal, what I do to successfully accomplish my dreams. Hopefully, I can achieve 90% of all things I sketch in my vision board. ","I like to spend few minutes calming myself down after taking therapeutic quiz. I was walking on the way home, and it was such a good opportunity for me to reflect myself. It was such a therapeutic to clear my mind and force me to enjoy the weather, the wind, the street, the random people walking. Suddenly, I feel so blessed. I feel blessed that I’m still breathing normally. I feel myself privileged to have a healthy body that I can use for school and work. And I had so many questions came up. How do I see the world when I’m no longer connected? How does the world see me? Then comes the biggest lesson: how the world sees me is how I see myself. And here I am… flawed, out of focus, waiting to be colored all over. As long as there’s light, I want to reflect.","The activity that I choose this time is cooking a new meal that I have not tried yet. Trying a new recipe is such an interesting activity for me because cooking is the way that force to pay more attention, help my creativity flow, and be more in the moment. I got personal satisfaction after trying a new recipe. I feel healed and rewarded after enjoying my meal. Cooking a new dinner dish this time enabled me to create something I have not taken the opportunity to do; and figured out myself that I could manage things in my control like how much seasoning should I add in, check the temperature, the time to cook. Now, I have a new dish that add to my recipe list.","The activity I choose to day is gratitude. I write a reminder for myself: Don’t let anyone control me. I don’t depend on anyone. Gratitude: 5 things that I feel grateful: - I have a good health. I’m healthy. So, I can work and study and do whatever I want in my life. Good health means I have the positive energy to study, work, and serve community. -I have a happy and stable family who always support me, and home is a safe place for me to be back after a long and tiring day. -I have some close friends I can trust and share lots of things in my life. -I am in the progress to be a future pharmacist which means I can use my ability and knowledge to help lots of people in the future, I want to be a useful person. - I have clean food and water to use daily which is already a huge blessing.",,"I’m questioning myself How am I feeling? What does the feeling come from? I am feeling low today. Maybe it’s depression, maybe I am just feeling sad and lonely. Either way, I am not feeling like my best self. Sometimes, I feel like being human is so hard; especially, being emotional unstable is such a challenge for me to handle. I know these negative feelings are just temporary, and I am aware that these negative energies will go away soon. But I really need time to process these emotions. I recognize the feeling of sadness and loneliness, so I need to face with these roller-coaster feelings. Thus, I am able to learn how to accept them, and it turns out easier for me to move on.  To be frank, it seems like it’s quite difficult for me to express my emotions. Nobody truly understands what I’m feeling or I’m thinking. Therefore, I think I need a little pause from life. I keep reminding myself that true healing occurs when I give myself permission to feel whatever feelings live below the triggers. I should choose to focus on what brings me happiness. I invite something nicer to come up and calm the negative energies. I read some inspiring words. I listen to a piece of beautiful music. I go somewhere in nature or I do some walking meditation. These activities help me to boost up my energy and bring me joy. I believe that I gradually feel better soon. ","I want to spend this moment to make a list of things that reflect what lessons I have learned so far. -I read my old journal and realized that the old version of me in the past were so patient, hardworking, innocent, joyful, and responsible. I found my old self and all the memories suddenly awaked after reading my old diaries and journals. I miss the old me a lot.-I started writing journal more often. This helps me to keep the presence moment in the paper and put my thoughts into words help me to express my ideas and reflect myself as well as discover the things clearer and broader.-I write a letter for my future self. I have a vision board to list the goals I want to achieve, to understand deeper my purposes, and to know who I want to become, to reach my dreams and to improve myself.","Assessing Occupational Wellness: I opened my LinkedIn account and started searching some jobs opening as well as connecting with lots of professional people on LinkedIn; then, I recognized that there are so many talented, productive, amazing and hardworking people on this social platform. I review their profiles and really admire their works. They have achieved so many goals in their professional career. I also question myself how can they are so productive and passionate about things they do? What motivation to keep them going and working that hard? How can I connect with these people? so I can learn from them. Exploring a variety of profiles from different backgrounds and occupations truly inspires me to work harder, study harder, and I want to contribute my work, knowledge, and skills to the world. ","I just want to be me. Be yourself: behave in a natural way, rather than trying to pretend to be different. Personality contains a variety of aspects. Personal values or authentic self. People respect those who are authentic to who they are. I spend most of my time alone a lot. Knowing who you are simply puts you in a position to make choices that complement your preferences.You are a beautifully unique, complex individual with many different aspects to your personality. Ask yourself: which is the coolest and kindest version of myself to be right now?Start a journey of finding myself.I lost myself for too long. I do not take good care of myself, I changed myself in negative way; that was too bad. I miss the old Linh. The old Linh that used to work so hard, full of ambition with goals and plans, dedicate all my time to study. The old [student name] that used to be really happy and innocent. Starting this year, I will spend time to understand myself, take good care of myself, love myself more than anything else, myself is always the top priority.How to find myself? love myself by listening to my heart, know what is right for me, spend time and make effort to take good care of my skin, my health, my body, my brain, my hair, my emotion, my knowledge, my own vibe, my fashion style; create my own personality and character that I wish to become. Goal is to become a better version of myself, getting better and better every day, improve myself by following good habits.Understand myself, know my personality, respect my worth.","Spring is here. Today, I would like to spend a little time in the park to feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, the wind on my hair, and the nature sound around me. Lots of things are going on recently. It is such a relaxing time for me to destress this stressful and chaotic time. 
Walking outside today gives me the feeling of peaceful mind and inner calm. I truly appreciate and enjoy this moment. 
I would like to spend few minutes in silence, not to do anything, just feel the present, feel the nature, feel my true self. It is such a healing time for me. 
After that, I feel so much better and refresh, inspire me to be more creative and work harder, and feel more grateful about my life. ",,"This class time is such a mental rest for me. It is critical to avoid me burnout. Taking time to rest mentally is as giving myself a break from utilizing any of the muscles in my brain, and it is important to my overall health and well-being. ","The current situation that I have gone through inspires me to choose the module that I would like to reflect. It depends on how my day is going, how I feel, how I think about my life, my relationships, my career in order to pick the module that I feel relatable most. ","It is such a therapeutic way for me to calm my mind down a bit in a chaotic and busy life. Spending this time brings more positive mindset to me. I’m deeply grateful for this activity because I have a time to understand myself more. Sometimes putting my thoughts into words helps me to clear my mind out and clarity comes back. After writing down everything in my mind, I feel like my thoughts lose the ability to take control my mind and stop bothering me. Looking at the words I write is like looking inside myself sometimes. Keeping those words and reading them will help remind me of who I am. "

Often, it is easy to keep pushing back self-care and my own health and wellness during a busy week, but the class time has carved out that time for me and I look at it as something that is ‘set in stone,’ so I have to do it which is great.","I decide on my self-care activity based on the needs of my body and my mental health. If I am feeling tired, I will use that time to nap.

Last quarter one of my mentor team members did a presentation on habit and habit forming. I do well with habits and can even be a bit rigid when it comes to  routines and I don’t do well with having to be flexible with my habits. One thing my team member mentioned was how habits evolve with you, and that they also should serve you instead of stressing you out beyond what is reasonable. I found this enlightening because I usually think of habits as something foundational and static that I can rely on, when actually your habits should serve a purpose in your life. I guess I learned that it is okay for your habits to change with you. The other one was when we made the paracord keychain last week. While it wasn’t a learning-oriented session, it was really nice to do something with my hands that isn’t work-related. Even though my paracord lanyard turned out not how I expected, I was happy with how it turned out because for just a little bit I was doing something other than studying. When I was younger I used to color in coloring books, and i got the same peaceful feeling when doing the paracord lanyard. After this, I  went and found my adult coloring book i have and worked on a piece that I’ve been coloring for the last year or so. ","Fortunately, I actually build self-care into each of my days, even if it’s calling my family on my drive home from school/work, or getting up a bit earlier to go bouldering before class. I am thankful that I have the time to add self-care into almost all of my daily activities. I didn’t ever have to actively choose an activity from the choice board because I was already doing something self-care oriented, so I simply reported my self-care activity that I was doing for the day. ","I am a grumpy and imbalanced person without my self-care routine, even if I have to modify it. It is something I use to maintain my mental health, and I find that I am less stressed and much more efficient when it comes to studying when I engage in my activities. Even if it’s only a 20 minute walk outside, my self-care routine keeps me sane during school.  During this year, it was nice to have reminders to prioritize self-care and helped keep any guilt I sometimes feel for taking time away from work/school away. "
39,,"I closed my eyes for 10 minutes and exercised for the other 10 minutes, and afterwards I felt rejuvenated physically and mentally.","Today I went out to get some fresh air to clear my head, and walked around. This activity took in total 20 minutes.","Today I tried to draw an anime character for 20 minutes. Even though the end result was not to my liking, but it was something to get my mind off of school at least.","With the given three day weekend, I took some time to relax and rest as much as I could to recover from long week 7. ","I was watching videos of Vietnam, and I was thinking about how my life is very different than those in Vietnam. Therefore, I came up with 5 things I’m grateful for living here compared to living in Vietnam, here I have: freedom to freely think and express my thoughts, access to clean water, roof over my head, food, and education. After reflecting I found that there is no other place I would be than here in America the land of freedom and opportunity.",,"Today I jogged around the neighborhood, try to get as much of the fresh air as I can, and clear my mind from school.",After WIP I came home and spent 20 minutes to rest up before studying for the MEDCHEM exam this Friday.,After coming from WIP I went to my room put on some calm relaxing music and meditated for 20 minutes.,"Today, I just took some time to escape from my worries and stress about the exam tomorrow by sitting at my desk and watch some comedies to laugh my stress and worries away.","Today I had to step away from everything school related by spending some time to build a plastic model, and it’s been awhile since I build something. Totally worth it and definitely reminded me why I started the hobby in the first place…..and now back to work.",,"Overall, it was something different in a good way because to be absolutely honest I have been stressed with all the school work, exams, and felt at times where I lost all motivation to continue school but through mentor team discussions and activities we have done in the mentor meeting I felt that I could escape from school and anything related to school for a day. A moment to be free in other words and that helped a lot.","In honesty, I believe I chose what I chose in each module is based strictly on how I feel that day. For example, if I feel like I need to listen to music and relax then I would do that over creating something because in the moment creating something could pose as a stress to me over laying in bed and close my eyes listening to music. ","For the most part, it helped a bit especially on weeks that we have a lot on our plates. Such as, this week for example where I had capstone, in-service for WIP, assignments due within the week, and exam Friday. Though weeks like this I tend to self-care a lot more than on our “off” easy weeks. In conclusion, I would have to say the choices that I decided is what is keeping me going through pharmacy school."

","This week I selected another nature option to help me to relax:  Walking through my neighborhood at night admiring the Christmas light holdovers.  They are so gorgeous, especially on a clear, cold night.  I will do this tonight (Wednesday) after I finish my schoolwork.","This week for my Health Wellness Self Care choice, I decided to work on mindfulness.  I have a breathing app on my watch, so I used it to focus on my breathing for 15 minutes.  It was actually wonderful just checking in with myself in this regard.  After 15 minutes, I felt relaxed and refreshed!  I'll have to try that again on a day that I may be feeling anxious about work or school.","This past week I chose to focus on getting out in nature.  We spend so much time indoors studying, in class, or working so I wanted to take advantage of a beautiful winter's day and get out for a bit.  I actually took time to drive to a different neighborhood (Magnolia!) and walk along the bluff.  The water, the boats, the ferry, even the cargo ship were all such a wonderful part of the ""urban slice"" of life in those 30 minutes.  I topped it off with a latte in the Village.  #love","After WIP today, I decided to relax by listening to some ocean music to destress from the business of the hospital environment and all that we had been working on.  It was a wonderful way to think about vacation at the end of the quarter.  So glad to have had a break!",,"Yesterday after WIP was a beautiful afternoon.  I went to the park near the hospital and walked through it, enjoying all of the beautiful trees in bloom for spring!  Decided to grab a coffee as well and sit on one of the park benches, enjoying the sunshine!!  ","Took the opportunity today to listen to bird sounds on my way home from the hospital.  Even though the weather wasn’t optimal, the “birds” made my drive home super enjoyable!",It was nice this week after my WIP training!  I walked through the park near the hospital and grabbed a coffee at the Starbucks.  Lots of people out walking their dogs in the park- only wihs I could've had mine with me too!! [photo],"This week I've decided to bake!  I took some time when I got home and baked some banana bread for my son to take home when he next visits.  It reminded me of all of the times when he was a little guy.  We used to love to bake together.  Chocolate chip was always the fave.  He had a special apron and a ""cookie dough"" bowl that we'd made together at Paint the Town.  He has always loved those memories- even now that he is a grown man- LOL.  Baking always recounts those wonderful years with my kids.  It was just what I needed this week.","I decided to listen to music for a 30 min break between WIP and IWS on Wednesday.  It was a nice day out so I sat outside.  The sunshine brightens everything and lightens my mood, always.
Great to focus on mindfulness, if only for 30 minutes.",,"I have greatly appreciated that we have devoted time as part of our curriculum to focus on health, wellness, and self-care. School, work, and commuting, together, is a tremendous burden and it would be so easy to succumb to the stress of it.  It is helpful as well, that we spend time sharing with our peers during our Group Breakout sessions so that we not only get to know one another better, but also, to share experiences.  Somehow it makes it easier when you realize that you aren’t the only one trying to juggle a bunch of balls at the same time.  If it weren’t for this time being part of what we do in this class, it wouldn’t be the same, and certainly not “as healthy”.  Thank you for being great listeners and wonderful mentors.","For me, I sort of let the decision that week be organic.  Really depended on how I was feeling that day/week.  I loved all the various choices! I generally found myself selecting those that were “calming” and totally different from work or school.  The exercise allowed me to think about things other than my to-do list, and that was wonderful!  It’s also helped me to see the value in doing so; I’d like to make this a permanent part of my weekly routine.","Self-care is generally what goes out the window for me first when I am under time pressure.  As an example:  I don’t have time to work out.  It’s a choice, but a strange one for me because I’ve always been dedicated to doing so.  I feel very stressed each week because as an older student, I must spend countless hours with subjects like Med Chem, so my free time choices rarely happen.  By having a reminder, an opportunity to focus on self-care, it suddenly becomes something viable.  It doesn’t have to be hours- just 15 or 20 minutes, and it makes a huge difference in my clarity, outlook, and happiness.  "

From one of my mentor team discussions, I got to research a little bit of information about self-compassion and learned a lot from the readings. Similar to being compassionate to the people we love, self-compassion is about being compassionate to ourselves.","What influenced my decision was solely my intuition. I did whatever I felt like or needed at that specific moment. If I needed to talk about something that had been weighing my heart, I would text/call my best friend; if I felt like napping, I would take a nap; if I felt like getting out of my room, I would go for a walk.","It helped me realize that it is important to leave extra room in your life for self-care regardless of how busy your schedule is. Without good mental health, it is impossible to achieve your goals and succeed."
42,,I went to the gym and did 40 minutes of cardio activities with one of my good friends.,Decided to make chicken parmigiana with fresh pasta. FYI if you do decide to do this it take a long time. ,"I decided to listen to some new music. Personally I liked on the The Weeknd's new song called Gasoline. Would put that song into the synth pop genre. Reminded me a lot of When in Rome's- The Promise. In addition, I also enjoyed the Mon Amour-Remix, however, my Spanish is not up to par to translate it or sing it.  ",This was my birthday weekend so I went out to eat with my family in the area and my best friend came up from Olympia and stayed the night.

Not sure if I got any photos that I particular like but it was nice to go out and do something stress free. ,,"I took a walk to the store this morning to buy some groceries, Sudafed, and Zyrtec as the seasonal allergies are absolutely making me suffer.

Was therapeutic to take a break from studying. ,I went down to the gym to help relieve some stress from studying. ,Decided to get up earlier today to make breakfast. Hopefully I start to feel better today as I have recently felt quite terrible. ,,"In general, the class time devoted to health and wellness has allowed me to step away from school and do something I enjoy then come back refreshed. I think this something that is key and something that I had not done before scholastically because it is often easy to feel burned out if all your doing with every waking hour is studying, reading textbooks, or rewatching lectures. I feel like this time has allowed to be more efficient with the time I have because I can always look forward to that short break that allows me to do what I want and step away from school.  ","I think what helped me decide what decision I made was based on what I had neglected to do when I stepped away from studying last. For example, if I went and hung out with a friend but missed my opportunity to go take pictures of nature then I felt I needed to go do that.  ",I think the time I spend on self-care positively affected me because it gave me an excuse to do the things I love that I normally do not. I think it allowed me to focus better and not mind sitting down and studying because I felt refreshed.

My decision is also influenced by what I am feeling that day. If the weather is nice, I have a sudden urge to go outside for a walk and look at the greenery.",It has allowed me more time to relax so I feel less stressed.

Example: 
Is your ambition really so weak?
What is going to matter in 5 years: how you feel in this moment or what you make of your time right now?",,"The class time for mentor team discussions has reminded me the importance of play. In my group, we’ve incorporated various games like Categories and Hotseat. I am currently in a rut emotionally and mentally and starting to embark on a journey to revitalize my motivations and joy. One aspect I want to incorporate into this is enjoyment in play. I had a class in undergrad called the Sociology of Happiness. In one of the modules, it stressed how “play” can lead to happier lives. While there are various avenues such as imaginative play or body play, I hope to actively incorporate this into my schedule and to revitalize my creativity.","This quarter was quite stressful for me, albeit a different sort of stress than last quarter. While last quarter was truly debilitating, this quarter’s stress was more of a low burn. I chose my self-care based on what I truly felt my body and mental health needed in that moment, whether it was a small task I had been putting off but would make me feel exponentially better or allowing my body the mercy to do nothing and recover.",This time dedicated to self-care helped me think about self-care in a different perspective. I hope to incorporate self-care as a scheduled necessity rather than a last ditch effort to preserve some sanity. I hope to view self-care as fuel to take care of myself so that I am fully invigorated to accomplish my goals rather than a pitstop when I’m only running low.
45,,I went to my apartment building gym and worked out for an hour. It felt so good to sweat and get out of my room into a different space where I'm not looking into a screen all day.,"Something I did this past weekend was get together with my siblings, boyfriend and friends and all went to an escape room. It was so much fun because I was not thinking about any stress that I had or school one bit. My focus was directed towards the game for the whole hour. The specific one that we had chosen was called ""The Bank Job"", where we had to rob the bank, unfortunately we were not able to fully finish the job but we were so close. Overall I had a great time working together with my loved ones and getting away from my normal day to day tasks. I would recommend it to everyone. ",I went out to dinner with some of my classmates. It was a lot of fun to see each other outside of class and talk about things other than school.,"My skin has been getting quite a few breakouts recently so I've been keeping a dedicated time this past week to do a multi step skin care routine. Typically, t's really time consuming so I don't do much but it's been a lot of fun and overall made me feel so good. ",I had a spa day with my mom and sisters at this place in Bellevue.

It was super refreshing after sitting inside and studying for hours. ,Set aside an evening and went out for dinner with my friends. ,I went to go see and spend time with my grandparents.  ,I went on a long walk to gas works park from my apartment which was about 1.5 miles away. ,,"In the past 3 quarters, class time has given me time to take a breather and relax rather than worrying about school all the time.","I let my body and mind decide how I am feeling. If I feel exhausted and don’t want to be around other and don’t want to speak, I take the time to relax. On the other hand, If I feel that I need a distraction then I make plans with my family and friends. Either way, I come out of these feeling great. ",The time I spent on myself helped me take a step back revaluate my life and tell myself that I do indeed have time for things outside of school.

Moreover, getting to communicate with my mentor and team on different topics allowed me to appreciate the little things and see the importance of self-care.","For me, the activity that I chose to do was based on what I felt like I needed most at that moment. If I felt like I want to relax and get fresh air, I will go on a walk. And if I felt like I want to connect with others, I will hang out with my friends and do other activities.

57,,I spent my time listening to relaxing music while doing diamond painting. ,I took a walk at my local park. ,I rearranged night table and desk.  ,"Since it was a nice day yesterday, I took out my camera and walked about the neighborhood. ",I went out for dinner with friends and caught up with each other. ,,I took a walk at the park. ,I colored in a coloring book. ,I reorganized my closet. ,I took a nap. ,I went to get coffee with a friend. ,,Having class time devoted to my health and wellness and self-care helped me by forcing myself to take a short break and think about my mental state. This break allowed to look and plan ahead in what I needed to do for that week. The mentor team discussion helped with taking my mind off of pharmacy school and think about other aspect of life. ,"I often would choose activities that I enjoyed doing when I wasn’t in school and often the weather would impact my decision. For example if the weather was sunny, I am more likely to do an activity that would connect me to the nature. However, if is rainy I would do a creative activity like diamond painting. ","After the self-care, I felt relaxed and re-charge for the rest of the week. It would put me in a positive mentality. "
58,,I took care of my orchids that I flew all the way from Seattle (and plan on flying back with me!). ,"To relax this week, I decluttered and cleaned my apartment for an hour. I know this might not seem like wellness but I genuinely love cleaning and organizing. Plus my apartment looks so clean and neat and beautiful now!",I took a nap w/ my cat,I made cinnamon rolls!,I cooked a new recipe I've been wanting to try out!,,I went to the gym!,I tried out a new recipe!,I hung out with my parents. ,Watered my plants,I watered my plants. ,,"In general, I do not think that the class time devoted to health and wellness has really done much. I think that the class discussions around it has been good at opening up and normalizing the discussion around mental health and having mental health and wellness as a priority at UW has definitely made the school a healthier and happier place. It’s also really great that Wednesdays are ‘cleared out’ for us to manage our mental health. On the other hand, I haven’t learned anything new in terms of coping skills, communication skills, etc. I think in terms of dealing with my own personal mental health issues, I’ve learned more from therapy, reading, etc.","Mental health to me means doing something relaxing that I want to do. Whenever every other Wednesday afternoon rolled around, I just did whatever it is in front of me that would help
me relax. If I needed to water my plants, then so be it. If my friends wanted to meet up, or my cats were feeling playful or the weather at the park was especially nice, then that sounds
good too. I decided based on what I wanted to do at the moment.","Self care to me means doing things that make me happy. As such, the time I spend doing my self care (which is much more than once every two weeks) generally improves my mood and as a result, my mental health."
59,,"This past weekend I spent a couple of hours enjoying the sunshine and going on a solo hike. I was feeling very overwhelmed after the first week of the quarter, but I realized that is all the more reason to take some time to do what I enjoy and take a break from school. I felt much better after, and was able to focus better when I resumed school work. Spending time by myself in nature always helps to reset my mental state and brings me happiness. ",The past Friday after class I was feeling very overwhelmed with the amount of studying and assignments I had to do over the weekend. After a long day of class I started to jump into completing homework for the weekend. I then realized I ha not taken a break yet that day so I decided to go for a long walk around my neighborhood. I ended up taking the night off and coming back to school work the next day and I was much more relaxed and productive.,This week I reached out to a friend I haven't seen in a while due to our busy schedules. It felt good to be able to plan a time to see each other and it was great way to de-stress from school. I hadn't realized how isolated I have been feeling until after I saw my friend and felt much less stressed and overwhelmed. ,"This past week I spent some much needed time resting after a long week of school. Friday, I had a long day of school and as usual was feeling stressed about the work I had to do for the coming weekend. I decided to take a nap and give myself some time to rest before starting homework. I knew that if I rested, I would be able to come back to homework with a clear head and that's exactly what happened.","Over the weekend I decided to cook as a mode of self care for myself. Cooking is something I got interested in a few years ago and it was something I could do that relaxed me. After starting pharmacy school, I became busy and didn't cook as often so it felt nice to get back into it after awhile and to take a night off from school before finals.",,"This week I went to the gym a few days after class. It's been a couple years since I felt safe going to a gym but even after a few sessions, it has helped me a lot with my stress management and self image. It has been a good way to start off the quarter by allowing myself to reserve a couple hours a day to just clear my head after class instead of going straight into doing homework and studying. I find that after working out, I am more productive with school work as well.",This week I spent half an hour meditating with the use of a guide video. One of my classmates guided a meditation in our group meeting and I found it to be very helpful in reducing my stress. I felt much calmer and was more productive after the meditation was over.,This week I went for a walk at the arboretum near campus. It was a really nice and sunny day and it helped to manage the stress I had going into a heavy exam week. It was a good way to start the week and the nice day and relaxing walk gave me motivation to study. I always feel less stressed and more productive with little breaks outside and exploring new parks.,This week I made the step to go back to therapy and find a therapist. I have been feeling like I needed a therapist to start helping with my mental health. I had been having barriers due to wait times and insurance issues. I had my first couple of sessions and it has been really helpful to learn strategies to cope with my anxiety as it relates school and stress.,This week I was feeling like I needed some alone time in nature so I chose a close hike and spent some time hiking alone outdoors. It was a gorgeous day and it was good for me to get sunshine and fresh air before the stress of finals sets in. I think I want to incorporate time alone in nature at least once a week while the weather allows. ,,"The class time devoted to health and wellness has been helpful for me. It has been nice to have that reminder every couple of weeks to slow down and do something to take care of myself. It can be so easy with our busy schedules to forget to take time to relax, but it is so necessary. I really appreciated the mental health first aid session because I think that should be normalized and has the potential to help a lot of people. In many of my mentor team meetings, I was reminded of how important it is to get to know my classmates in a stress-free environment.","For me, I tried to choose an activity that I felt I needed at that time, but I also tried a variety of self-care activities. If I was feeling more isolated one week, I tried to fit in some social self-care, or if I felt creative one week, I tried something I normally wouldn’t do such as cooking or painting and if I was feeling overwhelmed or stressed, I tried to give myself some alone time in nature to help with that.","Every time I spent time on my choice of self-care I felt better afterwards. Whether that was socializing with friends, exercising, having alone time, or doing something creative. Each time I felt better and more able to manage my stress and school, even though each activity was different, they all helped me in different ways."

61,,"Today I chose to rest/relax by taking a nap. This activity resonated with me the most because I have not been sleeping as much as I should. I have also been going to sleep very late. I took a 30 minute nap after Pharmacy 512 PR concluded. When I woke up, I felt very refreshed.","This week, the activity that resonated with me the most was social connectedness. Today I studied for my PCEUT532 class with a friend at my apartment. This was nice because I have not had many social encounters since classes have been remote for the past 4 weeks. ",Today I chose to rest and relax by discovering and listening to new music!,Today I engaged in social connectedness. I FaceTimed with my mom and dad this afternoon for about an hour. This was really nice because I had not spoken to them on the phone in a few weeks. They asked how I was doing which is question I hear less often living alone and being in a program where my classmates are going through the same stress I am. ,Today I choose to connect to nature by watering all of the plants in my apartment and running two miles along Greenlake.,,Today I took a long walk around my neighborhood to get some fresh air. The weather outside was too nice and sunny to not take advantage of.,"Today for breakfast I made some yogurt with apples, granola, and honey. I also made some buttered toast.",Today I chose to rest and relax by taking an hour nap. I was not feeling well so this helped me.,Today I choose to do a 30 minute at home workout. I have been trying to keep a consistent workout schedule starting this week and so far it is going very well.,Today I chose to take a nap before work.,,"Over the past 3 quarters I have tried my best to take advantage of the class time devoted to health, wellness, and self-care, but I still find it very difficult to devote that time for myself. I sometimes feel that I fail to spend my time in a way that positively affects my mental health. During the fall quarter, I found it very easy to devote this time for myself, but during the winter and spring quarter I struggled to maintain this routine. Usually, I would go running around Greenlake, but now I use this time to work closing shifts at my internship. If this continues to be my routine then I will have to find a way to shift my mindset (e.g., see the positive, practice gratitude, etc.) and find time during the other days of the week to work on my health, wellness, and self-care.","I decided on how to participate in each self-care module by listening to how my body and mind were feeling on that specific day. For example, if I did not rest well the night prior, I would choose to “rest/relax” by taking a nap. Another example is, if I had a scheduled closing shift that day and did not have time to nap, exercise, or meet up with friends, then I would participate in the create module by cooking myself a meal before or after my shift.","By listening to what state my mind and body were in, I was able to choose activities that benefited my health and well-being instead of hurting it. An example of this is when I would choose to spend my time doing yoga after catching up on schoolwork/studying. Spending several hours seated in my kitchen and stimulating my brain would leave me stressed out, so having that little bit of extra time to do yoga really helped my mental health and managing the stress from my workload."
62,,"Today for some self care, I did some rest and relaxation. I played myself some music and folded 2 loads of laundry, a task I tend to let pile up, literally. I find the neat, nice stacks of clothes very satisfying. I just don't get the time to fold the clothes and sort them out as often anymore, so I feel relaxed and productive! :)","Today, I spent some time at the grocery store. I know that's not normally relaxing, but I had more time today and go to visit 99 Ranch, an asian market I don't get to visit as often as it's a little bit further away. I am planning on making some dumplings for Lunar New Year next week and wanted to stock up on some supplies and buy lots and lots of sweet snacks for friends, family, and co-workers to celebrate with. I love celebrating Lunar New Year, so it was really fun for me today to take some time and shop around for all the yummy goodies (and definitely save some money when it comes to sauces, meat, and veggies) :)","Something I did this weekend was go to a friend's home for a game night. I don't get the chance to see my friends as often as I would like to anymore and usually I only see the same group of friends. So it was nice to spend some time this weekend and go to a new home and play some new games with my friends. We played games like Codenames and Exploding Kittens, which are great team games I don't normally get to play with just my boyfriend. It was a lot of fun and getting to sleep in the next morning was a huge bonus too. ","Today I got to play video games with my boyfriend. Yes, it's something we do quite often together. However, with class at home today and me not being at my WIP site, he also happened to have the day off. This is the first day we've had a day off together without having to go somewhere to meet people in a long time, so it was nice to take some time and just sit and relax and play games together. :)","I was SO lucky this week to have some family in town. My brother-in-law and his partner came to spend some time with us this weekend and part of the week. We were able to spend a lot of time together going to breweries, playing games, and enjoying the hot tub. It was so much fun, I already miss them so much. I was so happy to catch up with them and explore more of the Seattle area. ",,"Yesterday because our class ended a little early and I had a student cancellation, I got to join my boyfriend in a nice long walk with our dog. We walked around and played Pokémon Go, I got some really cute pictures of the two of them with a blossoming Japanese cherry tree, and we got to walk on this little trail that connects two streets in my neighborhood. It was a great walk!  ","I love playing video games. Growing up, I wasn't allowed any video games so lo and behold since my 20's I've been trying to make up for a lot. My boyfriend has been playing Halo since it came out way back in the early 2000s and has been trying to get me to play it for years. I finally caved in an attempt to distract myself from finals in fall quarter. And of course I fell in love with the whole franchise. So we played some video games together, now working through the games on the hardest difficulty. One level took us an hour today! But I have lots of fun playing them and spending time with my guy. :)","Today's calming activity was simple, I took a nap. I crawled back into bed, my dog climbed in under the covers, and I got to cuddle her. She's an excellent source of comfort always so I was glad to spend some time with her relaxing. :)","I finally got to go to Costco. I have been needing to go forever and it was so nice to go with my boyfriend and finally get all of those things we've been needing (like, toilet paper). We got my dog wet food, and it was just really nice to give her some wet food in her slow feeder and see how much she enjoyed it. We've never given her that before so that was a fun little moment we got to have. :)","I was so lucky, I got to go to the Woodland Park Zoo for member appreciation night. It was a fun night with some after hours access. We got to see the new butterfly exhibit and I got some really amazing pictures of butterflies. I also got to see the Komodo dragon actually moving around, I've never seen that before, it was so cool! It was such a nice fun and relaxing night, really grateful we've been able to make the most out of our membership there. :)",,"I cannot emphasize enough how much it has meant to have a dedicated “day off” almost every other week. At bare minimum it has been so nice to have just a class at home that just focuses on tying together all the extra details we have been going through. The WIP rotation, while it’s not super high intensity, is a bit draining sometimes so having the “off week” in between helps a lot to collect and gather my thoughts again. ","Most of my self-care has been spent in the relaxing category. I have been feeling burnt out, like, a lot. It has been so nice for the course instructors and my advisor to consistently remind us to take the time to practice self-care, but sometimes it just feels like not enough. But that’s also the burnout speaking, especially since part of the problem of the burnout is that I feel like there’s a mountain of work to do and study and then I can’t take the time off to properly relax so I end up procrastinating and not fully relaxing and thus just drawing out the burn, as it were. ","I really appreciate it. I hope we can keep this up next year, really. Again, as much as I look forward to going to my WIP site and working and everything else, I end up compacting my weekends with catching up with my family and boyfriend for everything I had put off during the work week, that those are just as exhaustive in some ways. So, it’s nice to sleep in, roll out of bed, and just review some notes, discuss something new, and take that little bit of extra time to relax. "
63,,I choose to do an activity that falls under rest/relax.

There was this taco salad recipe I wanted to try out and I finally had the opportunity to make it!,I took 30 minutes today to walk by the water and spent some time doing mediation by the water ,,These past quarters have really helped me take some time out of my day to take care of myself. I didn’t realize the high volume of coursework would affect me in a way where it interfered with daily simple tasks and having a set time to take care of myself or even doing it as homework was really refreshing. ,My decision was based on what I personally needed for the day. Ive been stuck going to classes and studying most of the day where I would forgot to take time out of my day to exercise so most of my decisions were based off of that. On heavier weeks where I had so much going on my mind I would choose to rest rather than exercise. I appreciated all the different options we were given. ,The time spent on my choice of self-care affected me in a positive manner. I would often choose to go on a brisk walk and it made me realize how beneficial it is to get out of my apartment and take some time for myself aside from school and put me back into balance.

I will continue to be working on other coursework to catch up on my classwork to help my occupational wellness and then take a short break to take a walk and watch a show before continuing in my studies. ,This week I will be spending some time expressing and sharing gratitude. These last couple of weeks have been really busy for me with multiple quizzes and exams falling around the same time and feeling like I have no time to move away from my computer screen without missing pertinent information or losing time. My fiance has been tremendously helpful in picking up the little things that I haven't been able to do and helping me to set up a good study environment so I can be successful. I haven't properly acknowledged his help and I want to spend time today showing gratitude by doing some of the dishes and telling him how meaningful his help is.,"This week I am working on my social connectedness. I have been spending my personal time working on some organization and planning for my wedding, as it is hard to find time to sit down and work on things. What I have been doing is getting in touch with distant family and friends I haven't spoken to in a while, and it has been really nice to catch up with people in my life that I love and talk about this exciting day coming up in my life and tell them how much it means to have them there. ",Today I am working on my rest/relaxation wellness. I have purchased my favorite flavor of Milanos (dark chocolate mint) and put on a pot of tea and am going to enjoy some TV and tea time before getting back into studying. ,"I am attempting to get back into running and today is a really beautiful day, so I am going to go for a run today before I dive back into studying for finals :). ",,Today I am working on my physical and emotional wellness and am spending some time with my dogs and taking them to the park for a bit to enjoy the sunshine. ,"This week is the holiday of Passover, so I was really excited to host my first Passover meal with my fiance and cook a huge, traditional meal and learn how to make Traditional Jewish recipes for the first time.

It has allowed me to spend more time with my family, study, and even learn a few new recipes. I think some of the mentor team discussions detracted a little from the self-care day as much of the time is interrupted and chopped up into blocks of conversation and the ‘catch-up’ feels a little less productive. The synchronous learning sessions are enjoyable and informative.",I thought a lot about how I was feeling that week and considered the amount of work I had in my pile. There were weeks where I felt especially anxious from being inside all the time so I forced myself to go on walks. There were weeks where I was closely following a tv show and wanted to keep tabs on that. It was nice to think. A little bit about what I wanted. ,"a.

65,,"To prepare for this quarter, I wanted to make sure I was healthy both mentally and physically. Unfortunately, I am still dealing with a thyroid issue that has caused problems all over my body. I get exhausted too easily now and I am tired all the time. The constant fear of COVID means mentally I am nowhere near ready, anytime I come home from being outside there is always a fear that I have caught it. I am starting to speak up a little more in class which is what I really wanted to get out of this quarter. Speaking just helps me become more comfortable in my future work environments. Hopefully, as I heal up, I can get on a regular schedule of sleep and studying but for now, I feel like I am already behind.","This week I chose rest/relax. Since I love sleeping, I chose to nap for 20 minutes (this turned into maybe a couple of hours??) It is what I needed to prepare for the 531 exam coming up. A mixture of catching a cold and studying for this test really wiped me out this week, and it feels like I was falling behind. The napped also helped relieve a little stress, which immediately came back when I started studying again.","Last week I really needed a chance to exercise and clear my brain. Unfortunately, I was still feeling sick from the week before. Therefore, the only choice I had was to rest/relax. I didn’t do as well as I would have liked on the 531 test and it has mentally affected me. I am already starting to worry about the rest of Pharmacy School, but I know it is going to be a step-by-step approach. Last weeks naps were not great because every nap meant less time studying and it really did not relax me. I hope by next journal I can figure out a way to relieve stress.","This week I combined being outdoors and breathing in the fresh air with one my favorite hobbies, shopping. I took a walk around the outlet mall in Marysville. It was fun and refreshing but disappointing as I didn’t really find what I was looking for. It did help a little but once I got home, I realized I have so much to do. I think the hardest part of this quarter, or any quarter is getting a bad start. For me it is so hard to just block it out and take each task as a separate task. I need to learn to not let one bad day become 2 or 3 or 4.",I took a random nap last week because the stress was getting to me. PCEU test on Friday has consumed my whole mind for the last week. I realized that the more I crammed the worse I got. At this point I am just trying to make to the end of the quarter and reset my mind. I hope to get a better start next quarter and continue to find more time for me.,,"My goal for this quarter is to find time to exercise and get at least 6 hours of sleep a night. I spent my last two quarters staying up late studying a day or two before an exam without getting even an hour of sleep. Though I got through the material, I could not recall the information during my exams. It’s crucial to get good grades, but I should not let myself deteriorate in the process.","I was able to get myself 6 hours of sleep every day last week. I reorganized my room to feel less cluster, then I went to Pike Place Market to take a walk and bought myself some fresh flowers last Saturday. ",I was able to exercise at least 2 hours twice a week to reduce stress and refresh my mind to prepare for my PCEUT exam on Monday.,I spent an hour at the gym 3 days a week since last week. This helps reduce my stress and refresh my mind for my upcoming Medchem exam this Friday. ,I took a break from studying and went to U-district annual street fair.,,"I think these classes helped me calm down a bit whenever I felt overwhelmed. Just thinking about a different topic gives me a mental break which at first I didn’t think I needed, but it was pretty helpful. This class also helped me critically think about the health of an employee and helped me realize what I do actually want out of a company after I graduate.","A lot of influence was more about the energy I had, a lot of weeks were spent resting, but recently I have started exercising more because it helps reduce stress. It also depended on what else was going on in life.","I will say, it helped just getting clear head so I can go back and hit the books/lectures. Without these breaks, I feel overwhelmed, so self-care time is very important."

If I choose to study during that time for an exam then I do it but most of the time it has helped me set aside a time in the day that is much needed to overall maintain mental wellness. I think it has been an important part of the curriculum as it is easy to forget to take a break. ,"I based my decisions on what most I needed from myself. I listened to my body and mind in what was lacking in my life at the moment. If I had been inside all week, then I made myself go outside and run. If I hadn’t eaten that day, I made myself take time to make a meal and just relax before diving back into homework. ",It helped clear my mind and maintain balance in my personal and school life.

These dedicated class time allows me to take a deeper breath, relax and think about something different than the heavy course load that us PY1s are facing each quarter, and I can loudly say that this has helped me tremendously in trying to balance my workload and my mental health. ","For me, my choice of how to participate in self-care depends on my mood at the time, therefore it can vary greatly. As an ambivert, I have moments where I would love to spend time with myself and connect with my own thoughts. However, I also enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends and try out new things with new people.

I think it’s important that we do whatever we can to spread awareness of mental health illnesses and create a safe space that welcomes these and related topics of discussion. The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has inspired me to do the same and has helped me not to be so hard on myself when I feel as though I am underperforming during times I am struggling with my own mental health.","Rather than picking between each self-care module, what worked better for me was participating in the self-care activities that I felt like doing in the moment then documenting them/seeing where they fit in the choice board afterwards.

I used to feel guilty if I treated myself to an episode of my show, or going to hangout with my friends knowing that I should be studying, but these assignments remind me that it is important that I am not cooped up studying all day.","When deciding what to choose from the choice board, it really all came down to how I was feeling what week and how much time I was willing to put aside for myself. For example, if I was feeling motivated to study and get a lot of school work done that week, I probably would have picked a more quick task from the choice board (such as taking a short nap or doing a quick arts and crafts project). If I was feeling really mentally out of it and needed a real break from everything, then I would treat myself to episodes of my favorite show or hit up a friend and ask for them to keep me company to get my mind off things.",The time I spent on self-care helped me avoid the many mental breakdowns that I think I would have experienced if I were to not spend time focusing on my mental health.

Skills such as compassionate communication is very important as we will be interacting with people in our careers. We need to learn and practice how to effectively interact with them to be competent pharmacists. The self-care session was also worthwhile, it served as a reminder to take time out for ourselves. It was difficult sometimes, especially when other classes got hectic. During these weeks, it was hard to engage completely in the wellness activities but nevertheless I still very much appreciated it. I tend to forget the most basic things when I get stressed about something so these activities helped me step back and reevaluate things. ","My decision to choose an activity varied quite a bit. If it was exam week and I was mostly stuck inside studying then I would choose to step outside and connect with nature (for example, I would go for a walk).

Sometimes I felt that the mental health and self-care assignments added more stress to my life and not having some of those assignments would have improved my mental health more than having to complete or participate in the session, especially during busier weeks. ","Each week I tried to think about how busy my week had been and what else I needed to complete by the end of the week before deciding what I needed for my self-care. I also tried to reflect on how I was feeling beyond stress to help dictate what activity I would complete each week. For example, if I was feeling unmotivated I would reach out to someone who supports me to get some words of encouragement or if I was feeling lethargic I would do some yoga or take a walk. I think that trying to be more aware of what I am feeling helped me decide what activity I needed for self-care each week. ","The time I spend on my self-care helped me re-center myself and I really enjoyed having that “break” in the middle of the week to just break up the routine. I felt that some weeks I really needed to take the time for self-care, but others I did not feel the time was helpful or the most convenient for me. I think having the ability to pick what time or day that you do your self-care would be more helpful sometime, rather than having to do the activity on the same day as class. I do think that the self-care time is important and having designated time to think about my own needs reminded me to take the time to practice self-care. "

couple times, create where I started getting back into making paracord, rest/relax such as
running or taking a walk. What influenced my decision was mostly the weather but also how
I was feeling. Did I need something to distract me? I would do paracord. Did I need something to get my adrenaline pumping? I would run. Did I need time to escape from the busy world we are in? I would hike.","It affected me in a positive way once I had done it, but it also affected me negatively.

Other days I would feel extra hungry and decided to put more effort into making a nice meal. Other days I would feel a bit lonely and took the time to catch up with family or friends.

But if I felt I had spent little time connecting with my friends and family, I would choose to prioritize that to ensure that I was content and can move forward with the next activity. In one way, one can see this as another form of relaxation, but the differing factor is whether I want to spend time for myself or with others.","The way how the time spent on my choices of self-care have affected me would be that I had allowed me to improve my mental health such that I was able to better connect with my friends and spend time with them outside of just school. Not only that, it allowed me to rest up and take a break from the amount of stress built up from school and the workload from work. It also caused me to build more confidence as a person and not overthink a situation but rather, assess it rationally and act accordingly. "

A lot of the time, I was spending time on my own and clearing my own head because I don’t get a lot of alone time anymore. I am with friends and loved ones all day. A little time to myself doing grocery shopping or cooking or cleaning is a real necessity right now. ","For myself, life is a constant balance of being happy and being busy. I am always trying to find that perfect balance, so things don’t get boring, and I don’t get sad. Having time to figure everything out has granted me that much more mental clarity and I feel my balance is getting a lot better! "

A classmate showed me how they have been organizing their notes in flow charts/mind maps for certain courses (i.e. therapeutics) which I am going to start doing because I recognize the value of having concise notes that are structured in a way that is easy to refer to/refresh our understanding rather than writing journals full of extensive notes which is time consuming and not as organized/helpful for studying or recalling specific drug information (indications, side effects, dosing regimens/adjustments, etc.).

For instance, if I felt like I was particularly struggling with pressure/stress, I worked in building resilience coping skills (mindfulness, breathing exercises, self-compassion). For another example, if I felt isolated or the need to externally process my emotions- I would choose to participate in self-care through social connectedness by spending time with friends/family.
