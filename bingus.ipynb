While I am fairly good at finding pockets of time for self-care myself, class sessions such as the mentor team discussions provided a space for me to engage in something I normally wouldn’t think to do, such as introducing me to new games to play in a group setting. This in particular is enjoyable in that I get to socialize with classmates I don’t normally extensively converse or hang out with.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care really helped me to spend time doing what I enjoy and having class time devoted to this made me realize how important self-care is to ensure success in my personal and professional life. I really appreciate the mentor team discussions because it makes me realize that I’m not alone and that I have the support from my mentor and classmates to help me do well in the program. ',\n",
       " 'The class time has reminded me on the importance of self care and that there are also people in the class who are going through the same thing and that none of us are alone. Additionally, it has shown me that even if it is not a long time to do the things that will help me relax, even a little bit of time helps and goes a long way. I think that during this time, I have done more self care than I usually do, especially mentally, which is nice. ',\n",
       " 'The class time that was devoted to health and wellness and self-care was nice to have because it allowed me to have time away from school work and to relax for a little before having to stress again',\n",

I try to put myself in the persons shoes and imagine how they would feel and how I would like to be treated if I were on the opposite side of the equation.',\n",
       " 'Ans: Over the past three quarters the time for health and wellness has been so helpful and much required. \\nI utilized it for many purposes. For nature connection, for development and growth, to rest and relax. It was a great break from the fast stress full and always busy life that we all have. ',\n",

I didn’t find myself going out of my way to do a self care activity for the assignment, but I do think the checking in with myself each day to ask if I had been taking care of myself was very beneficial.

Although, I don’t always have much to say, I liked being in a smaller group with people who I don’t talk to regularly. This brought in a lot of different ideas and perspectives. I remember there was a lesson on habits and another one on napping that gave me some new ideas on how I could improve my health and wellness. ',\n",
       " 'I think my favorite parts have been the mentor team discussions. I don’t live close, so while I have made some friends I am still a little bit more distant, having these team discussions helped me feel less alone and share with my peers. It was nice since I feel like my other family and friends do not fully understand everything I am doing, and I think just not feeling alone was more important to me then I would have thought.',\n",
       " 'I have enjoyed having the space to discuss health and wellness and want to thank the entire teaching team for providing that opportunity. It allowed time to focus on myself mentally, emotionally, and physically. The mentor team discussions provided a space to talk to my classmates and sometimes enjoy activities like Kahoot, which provided a good change in pace. ',\n",
       " 'I have found that the mentor team discussions have been a great way to get to know my mentor and a handful of other classmates better. It has been great to hear from them about their hobbies, growth over the past year, and venting about school or WIP or anything. I feel that these have been a safe space to have fun for about 20 minutes every two weeks. With the other areas of discussing health and wellness, I feel I would rather have that time back to actually contribute to my own health and wellness, and possibly have asynchronous work instead to learn about those opportunities or why taking care of our wellbeing first is important. Those sessions were interesting, but with our limited schedule, I would prefer to learn on my own time. ',\n",
       " 'It helped me be aware of the other things going on in life. Whether it’s a daily reminder to exercise or cook a meal for myself. The class time devoted to health and wellness overall made my quarter less stressful.',\n",

I am also very grateful for this time to reevaluate and assess my wellbeing in order to do well in school. It is important to take care of myself so that I may perform at my best.',\n",

If anything, it was a well-needed break from everything (the break I could not give myself). Also the fact that the class was scheduled to last to 2pm but ended earlier was really helpful because I did not feel like I was behind when I chose to give myself some more time after everything ended to take care of myself.  That feeling of being supposed to be in class but not actually being in class or missing anything helped, if that makes sense!',\n",
       " 'Over the past three quarters the class time devoted to health and wellness has affected me in a positive way. It just makes me feel cared for that my instructors understand that pharmacy school can be overwhelming and stressful to the students, and require that we do self care. Thank you all so much, it is much appreciated.',\n",

It has changed my mindset about how I care for myself, it is still an on-going process, yet it is a start. I like the mentor team discussions because I get to see how creative my classmates can be when it comes to health and wellness. Also, it is the one class where we can really open up and work on ourselves. There is an extreme amount of pressure in the road to becoming a future pharmacist, which can affect our mental, physical, and spiritual health. Part of me hopes that our pharmacy program also advocates for the well-being of its students. In the end, it will make us, the students, natural advocates for our patients as well.',\n",

I have learned a lot from my peers how they handle busy work-school schedule, or different study strategies to get through difficult courses this quarter.  ',\n",
       " 'It has been helpful in that the class has created a dedicated time and space for me to forget about everything else and focus on myself without distractions. Often, it is easy to keep pushing back self-care and my own health and wellness during a busy week, but the class time has carved out that time for me and I look at it as something that is ‘set in stone,’ so I have to do it which is great.',\n",
       " 'I have had a tremendous benefit from the mental health and wellness time. I usually take it to engage in a hobby or go for a stroll while listening to an audio book. I feel much less stressed and sense I have better focus throughout the week.',\n",
       " 'It has allowed me to have discussions with my other classmates to get a better understanding of how we all deal with stress in different ways. It has also assured me that I am not the only one who has difficulties outside of class and it is ok to take a step back and focus on my mental health.',\n",
       " 'I found 2 sessions from our mentor team discussions particularly interesting. Last quarter one of my mentor team members did a presentation on habit and habit forming. I do well with habits and can even be a bit rigid when it comes to  routines and I don’t do well with having to be flexible with my habits. One thing my team member mentioned was how habits evolve with you, and that they also should serve you instead of stressing you out beyond what is reasonable. I found this enlightening because I usually think of habits as something foundational and static that I can rely on, when actually your habits should serve a purpose in your life. I guess I learned that it is okay for your habits to change with you. The other one was when we made the paracord keychain last week. While it wasn’t a learning-oriented session, it was really nice to do something with my hands that isn’t work-related. Even though my paracord lanyard turned out not how I expected, I was happy with how it turned out because for just a little bit I was doing something other than studying. When I was younger I used to color in coloring books, and i got the same peaceful feeling when doing the paracord lanyard. After this, I  went and found my adult coloring book i have and worked on a piece that I’ve been coloring for the last year or so. ',\n",
       " 'Overall, it was something different in a good way because to be absolutely honest I have been stressed with all the school work, exams, and felt at times where I lost all motivation to continue school but through mentor team discussions and activities we have done in the mentor meeting I felt that I could escape from school and anything related to school for a day. A moment to be free in other words and that helped a lot.',\n",
       " 'I have greatly appreciated that we have devoted time as part of our curriculum to focus on health, wellness, and self-care. School, work, and commuting, together, is a tremendous burden and it would be so easy to succumb to the stress of it.  It is helpful as well, that we spend time sharing with our peers during our Group Breakout sessions so that we not only get to know one another better, but also, to share experiences.  Somehow it makes it easier when you realize that you aren’t the only one trying to juggle a bunch of balls at the same time.  If it weren’t for this time being part of what we do in this class, it wouldn’t be the same, and certainly not “as healthy”.  Thank you for being great listeners and wonderful mentors.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care provided me the time to spend with myself without setting aside other extra time from my schedule. From one of my mentor team discussions, I got to research a little bit of information about self-compassion and learned a lot from the readings. Similar to being compassionate to the people we love, self-compassion is about being compassionate to ourselves.',\n",
       " 'In general, the class time devoted to health and wellness has allowed me to step away from school and do something I enjoy then come back refreshed. I think this something that is key and something that I had not done before scholastically because it is often easy to feel burned out if all your doing with every waking hour is studying, reading textbooks, or rewatching lectures. I feel like this time has allowed to be more efficient with the time I have because I can always look forward to that short break that allows me to do what I want and step away from school.  ',\n",
       " 'It has allowed me time to rest and relax without feeling guilty about it. ',\n",

I am currently in a rut emotionally and mentally and starting to embark on a journey to revitalize my motivations and joy. One aspect I want to incorporate into this is enjoyment in play. I had a class in undergrad called the Sociology of Happiness. In one of the modules, it stressed how “play” can lead to happier lives. While there are various avenues such as imaginative play or body play, I hope to actively incorporate this into my schedule and to revitalize my creativity.',\n",

       " 'I really enjoyed this class as there was no stress behind it. We were able to learn relevant topics and tools, while also had some fun during our facilitations. I also appreciated the time allotted for our well-being and the sincere comments made by our professors. I also very much appreciated the transparency of our professors, It definitely made me like I belonged here and am cared for. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'I feel through this class we have connected more. We were able to talk to each other how to take care of our mental wellness, students sharing what they are doing to relive their stress and compassionate communication has improved our ability to communicate by just listening to each other. ',\n",
       " 'Over the past three quarters, the class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care had allowed me to refocus on the aspects of my life that I forgot about that are very comforting and enjoyable. Moreover, getting to communicate with my mentor and team on different topics allowed me to appreciate the little things and see the importance of self-care.',\n",
       " 'It allows me to develop a better self-care and health and wellness. I think the mentor team session was particularly helpful because we actually spent some time doing some fun and short activity that is not related to pharmacy stuff.

       " 'Class devoted to health and wellness has helped me by not only providing a safe space to express my concerns and stresses, but by also giving me an opportunity to learn how to cope with them in a healthy manner.',\n",

       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has affected me in a positive way.

       " 'Having class time devoted to my health and wellness and self-care helped me by forcing myself to take a short break and think about my mental state. This break allowed to look and plan ahead in what I needed to do for that week. The mentor team discussion helped with taking my mind off of pharmacy school and think about other aspect of life. ',\n",
       " 'In general, I do not think that the class time devoted to health and wellness has really done much. I think that the class discussions around it has been good at opening up and normalizing the discussion around mental health and having mental health and wellness as a priority at UW has definitely made the school a healthier and happier place. It’s also really great that Wednesdays are ‘cleared out’ for us to manage our mental health. On the other hand, I haven’t learned anything new in terms of coping skills, communication skills, etc. I think in terms of dealing with my own personal mental health issues, I’ve learned more from therapy, reading, etc.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness has been helpful for me. It has been nice to have that reminder every couple of weeks to slow down and do something to take care of myself. It can be so easy with our busy schedules to forget to take time to relax, but it is so necessary. I really appreciated the mental health first aid session because I think that should be normalized and has the potential to help a lot of people. In many of my mentor team meetings, I was reminded of how important it is to get to know my classmates in a stress-free environment.',\n",

       " 'Over the past 3 quarters I have tried my best to take advantage of the class time devoted to health, wellness, and self-care, but I still find it very difficult to devote that time for myself. I sometimes feel that I fail to spend my time in a way that positively affects my mental health. During the fall quarter, I found it very easy to devote this time for myself, but during the winter and spring quarter I struggled to maintain this routine. Usually, I would go running around Greenlake, but now I use this time to work closing shifts at my internship. If this continues to be my routine then I will have to find a way to shift my mindset (e.g., see the positive, practice gratitude, etc.) and find time during the other days of the week to work on my health, wellness, and self-care.',\n",
       " 'I cannot emphasize enough how much it has meant to have a dedicated “day off” almost every other week. At bare minimum it has been so nice to have just a class at home that just focuses on tying together all the extra details we have been going through. The WIP rotation, while it’s not super high intensity, is a bit draining sometimes so having the “off week” in between helps a lot to collect and gather my thoughts again. ',\n",
       " 'These past quarters have really helped me take some time out of my day to take care of myself. I didn’t realize the high volume of coursework would affect me in a way where it interfered with daily simple tasks and having a set time to take care of myself or even doing it as homework was really refreshing. ',\n",
       " 'I have really enjoyed having that extra catch up day to myself. It has allowed me to spend more time with my family, study, and even learn a few new recipes. I think some of the mentor team discussions detracted a little from the self-care day as much of the time is interrupted and chopped up into blocks of conversation and the ‘catch-up’ feels a little less productive. The synchronous learning sessions are enjoyable and informative.',\n",
       " 'I think these classes helped me calm down a bit whenever I felt overwhelmed. Just thinking about a different topic gives me a mental break which at first I didn’t think I needed, but it was pretty helpful. This class also helped me critically think about the health of an employee and helped me realize what I do actually want out of a company after I graduate.',\n",
       " 'It has given me a designated time where I focus on my self. If I choose to study during that time for an exam then I do it but most of the time it has helped me set aside a time in the day that is much needed to overall maintain mental wellness. I think it has been an important part of the curriculum as it is easy to forget to take a break. ',\n",
       " 'The most important thing I realized by having the class time devoted to health and wellness over the past 3 quarters was how much the instruction team and UWSOP value their students’ mental health wellness and I truly appreciate that. These dedicated class time allows me to take a deeper breath, relax and think about something different than the heavy course load that us PY1s are facing each quarter, and I can loudly say that this has helped me tremendously in trying to balance my workload and my mental health. ',\n",
       " 'I greatly value all of the time and attention that has been dedicated towards health, wellness, and self-care throughout this course series. I think it’s important that we do whatever we can to spread awareness of mental health illnesses and create a safe space that welcomes these and related topics of discussion. The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has inspired me to do the same and has helped me not to be so hard on myself when I feel as though I am underperforming during times I am struggling with my own mental health.',\n",

       " 'It is easy for us students to get caught up in all of the school work that is assigned to us and easy for us to forget to focus on ourselves. I really appreciate the emphasis and time that is provided In this class that allows us to focus on our mental health and well being otherwise I don’t think I would have put much attention to taking care of myself mentally. I used to feel guilty if I treated myself to an episode of my show, or going to hangout with my friends knowing that I should be studying, but these assignments remind me that it is important that I am not cooped up studying all day.',\n",
       " 'I’ve become more aware that self-care doesn’t have to be a big event. Just something small throughout the day that addresses your wellness counts as self-care.

Skills such as compassionate communication is very important as we will be interacting with people in our careers. We need to learn and practice how to effectively interact with them to be competent pharmacists. The self-care session was also worthwhile, it served as a reminder to take time out for ourselves. It was difficult sometimes, especially when other classes got hectic. During these weeks, it was hard to engage completely in the wellness activities but nevertheless I still very much appreciated it. I tend to forget the most basic things when I get stressed about something so these activities helped me step back and reevaluate things. ',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness has given me time at least every other week to think about other aspects of my life outside of my work and school commitments. I enjoyed getting to know about my classmates outside of studying together and it was nice to have more personal contact with the instructors. Sometimes I felt that the mental health and self-care assignments added more stress to my life and not having some of those assignments would have improved my mental health more than having to complete or participate in the session, especially during busier weeks.

I think the activities that the teachers gave us is a good reminder to take that time for selfcare. However, as the same time, it feels better to just be busy but have your tasks to be taken care of.',\n",

Otherwise, the class time devoted to health and wellness has helped pulled me back from all the stress that comes from school and life and just sit down and talk about anything.

Not only that, the time I have taken for myself allowed me to focus on myself and do activities I wouldn’t normally have time for since starting pharmacy school but also, help me manage my mental health. Not only that, it allowed me to connect to my friends and families and further develop my relationships with them.',\n",

I think these are important topics to address and I think there does need to be time built in, but it is nice to have a break in the day.
