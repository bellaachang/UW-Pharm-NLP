       "['The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has had a positive effect on me. While I am fairly good at finding pockets of time for self-care myself, class sessions such as the mentor team discussions provided a space for me to engage in something I normally wouldn’t think to do, such as introducing me to new games to play in a group setting. This in particular is enjoyable in that I get to socialize with classmates I don’t normally extensively converse or hang out with.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care really helped me to spend time doing what I enjoy and having class time devoted to this made me realize how important self-care is to ensure success in my personal and professional life. I really appreciate the mentor team discussions because it makes me realize that I’m not alone and that I have the support from my mentor and classmates to help me do well in the program. ',\n",
       " 'The class time has reminded me on the importance of self care and that there are also people in the class who are going through the same thing and that none of us are alone. Additionally, it has shown me that even if it is not a long time to do the things that will help me relax, even a little bit of time helps and goes a long way. I think that during this time, I have done more self care than I usually do, especially mentally, which is nice. ',\n",
       " 'The class time that was devoted to health and wellness and self-care was nice to have because it allowed me to have time away from school work and to relax for a little before having to stress again',\n",
       " 'I have learnt to listen to people without interrupting them and have learnt to fight the urge to give a relating scene from my life. I try to put myself in the persons shoes and imagine how they would feel and how I would like to be treated if I were on the opposite side of the equation.',\n",
       " 'Ans: Over the past three quarters the time for health and wellness has been so helpful and much required. \\nI utilized it for many purposes. For nature connection, for development and growth, to rest and relax. It was a great break from the fast stress full and always busy life that we all have. ',\n",
       " 'The mentor team sessions have been the most effective way for me to reflect on ways to improve my skills or to reflect on my progress as a future practitioner. In addition to having a good mindset to improve my skills in areas of compassion and growth as an individual.',\n",
       " 'I appreciated being allowed the time to take care of ourselves. It enhanced the feeling that the professors are mindful of our wellbeings. I didn’t find myself going out of my way to do a self care activity for the assignment, but I do think the checking in with myself each day to ask if I had been taking care of myself was very beneficial. ',\n",
       " 'I really liked having that time set aside to do something else. Also, playing some type of game in breakout rooms after class during the off week from the WIP site was pretty fun.',\n",
       " 'Mentor team meetings started last quarter and I have really appreciated them. Although, I don’t always have much to say, I liked being in a smaller group with people who I don’t talk to regularly. This brought in a lot of different ideas and perspectives. I remember there was a lesson on habits and another one on napping that gave me some new ideas on how I could improve my health and wellness. ',\n",
       " 'I think my favorite parts have been the mentor team discussions. I don’t live close, so while I have made some friends I am still a little bit more distant, having these team discussions helped me feel less alone and share with my peers. It was nice since I feel like my other family and friends do not fully understand everything I am doing, and I think just not feeling alone was more important to me then I would have thought.',\n",
       " 'I have enjoyed having the space to discuss health and wellness and want to thank the entire teaching team for providing that opportunity. It allowed time to focus on myself mentally, emotionally, and physically. The mentor team discussions provided a space to talk to my classmates and sometimes enjoy activities like Kahoot, which provided a good change in pace. ',\n",
       " 'I have found that the mentor team discussions have been a great way to get to know my mentor and a handful of other classmates better. It has been great to hear from them about their hobbies, growth over the past year, and venting about school or WIP or anything. I feel that these have been a safe space to have fun for about 20 minutes every two weeks. With the other areas of discussing health and wellness, I feel I would rather have that time back to actually contribute to my own health and wellness, and possibly have asynchronous work instead to learn about those opportunities or why taking care of our wellbeing first is important. Those sessions were interesting, but with our limited schedule, I would prefer to learn on my own time. ',\n",
       " 'It helped me be aware of the other things going on in life. Whether it’s a daily reminder to exercise or cook a meal for myself. The class time devoted to health and wellness overall made my quarter less stressful.',\n",
       " 'This class time has been absolutely vital in helping me practice effective self-care and wellness. The topics we discuss in class are imperative in aiding mental health. I am also very grateful for this time to reevaluate and assess my wellbeing in order to do well in school. It is important to take care of myself so that I may perform at my best.',\n",
       " 'A lot of the times I come in stressed from other classes and just waiting for the session to be over so I can go back to studying, but I have never regretted any of our discussions in class. If anything, it was a well-needed break from everything (the break I could not give myself). Also the fact that the class was scheduled to last to 2pm but ended earlier was really helpful because I did not feel like I was behind when I chose to give myself some more time after everything ended to take care of myself.  That feeling of being supposed to be in class but not actually being in class or missing anything helped, if that makes sense!',\n",
       " 'Over the past three quarters the class time devoted to health and wellness has affected me in a positive way. It just makes me feel cared for that my instructors understand that pharmacy school can be overwhelming and stressful to the students, and require that we do self care. Thank you all so much, it is much appreciated.',\n",
       " 'The dedicated class time has guaranteed an allotted time for me to relax, and it has helped my productive. I notice I don’t feel as anxious about meeting deadlines as much and more relaxed about schoolwork overall. ',\n",
       " 'The class has been very beneficial to me. It allows me to reflect on what I am doing in the quarter and gives me an opportunity to ask for help if I need it.',\n",
       " 'Over the past 3 months, I have more time spend on myself and reflect myself on how I want to enjoy this four-year of pharmacy school. I came to realized that doing non-school activities besides school helped me feel more happy and relaxing. ',\n",
       " 'I think the class time help me to balance out my very busy schedule. The class time also reminds me to take care my health and find time to spend with my family and my love one. The talking in mentor team discussions help us to know more about our classmates and shared our life experience which I think it’s very helpful especially during this pandemic time. ',\n",
       " 'I have been busier over the past 3 quarters. I feel burnt out more and more often. When I document my self-care for this class I always recall what I did that was relaxing and it helps with my mental health.',\n",
       " 'It has been really nice to have scheduled time fit in for my wellness. I feel that this is a really important part of the profession to avoid burnout but also it scared me that our field is so rough that we need classes set aside to remind us to do self care. ',\n",
       " 'It affected me in a way that help me manage my time more efficiently. ',\n",
       " 'I am now conscious of the need to take care of myself. I have come to understand and appreciate the need to take breaks and care for myself.',\n",
       " 'Honestly, I think there should be a whole class dedicated to health and wellness. It has been particularly useful, relaxing, and more than anything enjoyable. It has changed my mindset about how I care for myself, it is still an on-going process, yet it is a start. I like the mentor team discussions because I get to see how creative my classmates can be when it comes to health and wellness. Also, it is the one class where we can really open up and work on ourselves. There is an extreme amount of pressure in the road to becoming a future pharmacist, which can affect our mental, physical, and spiritual health. Part of me hopes that our pharmacy program also advocates for the well-being of its students. In the end, it will make us, the students, natural advocates for our patients as well.',\n",
       " 'I think that by having separate time that focuses on letting us take mental breaks have been very helpful. In a way it makes us take more time to consider about ourselves versus just going to class after class.  Having providers that care and ask about your day and overall how you are doing with class has made me feel more appreciated and welcomed. ',\n",
       " 'I think it allowed me to communicate with others and further developing my communication skills',\n",
       " 'Having built in time dedicated to self care/things I need to take care of every other Wednesday was nice for me to take time for myself an away from schoolwork for a little while. ',\n",
       " 'This class time is such a mental rest for me. It is critical to avoid me burnout. Taking time to rest mentally is as giving myself a break from utilizing any of the muscles in my brain, and it is important to my overall health and well-being. ',\n",
       " 'I think the mentor team discussions contributed a lot it allowed me to hear directly from my classmates that they have their struggles too with school, and with balancing personal life, work, and school at the same time. I really appreciate the effort that our professors put into content related to compassionate communication and didactic sessions as well.',\n",
       " 'I can find time for myself. However, I feel very stressed and sleep deprived. School work is moving so fast that I cannot catch up sometimes. ',\n",
       " 'I think mentor team discussions are great ways to actively listen to my peers as well as sharing our thoughts about different topics that we may don’t usually share with our family. I have learned a lot from my peers how they handle busy work-school schedule, or different study strategies to get through difficult courses this quarter.  ',\n",
       " 'It has been helpful in that the class has created a dedicated time and space for me to forget about everything else and focus on myself without distractions. Often, it is easy to keep pushing back self-care and my own health and wellness during a busy week, but the class time has carved out that time for me and I look at it as something that is ‘set in stone,’ so I have to do it which is great.',\n",
       " 'I have had a tremendous benefit from the mental health and wellness time. I usually take it to engage in a hobby or go for a stroll while listening to an audio book. I feel much less stressed and sense I have better focus throughout the week.',\n",
       " 'It has allowed me to have discussions with my other classmates to get a better understanding of how we all deal with stress in different ways. It has also assured me that I am not the only one who has difficulties outside of class and it is ok to take a step back and focus on my mental health.',\n",
       " 'I found 2 sessions from our mentor team discussions particularly interesting. Last quarter one of my mentor team members did a presentation on habit and habit forming. I do well with habits and can even be a bit rigid when it comes to  routines and I don’t do well with having to be flexible with my habits. One thing my team member mentioned was how habits evolve with you, and that they also should serve you instead of stressing you out beyond what is reasonable. I found this enlightening because I usually think of habits as something foundational and static that I can rely on, when actually your habits should serve a purpose in your life. I guess I learned that it is okay for your habits to change with you. The other one was when we made the paracord keychain last week. While it wasn’t a learning-oriented session, it was really nice to do something with my hands that isn’t work-related. Even though my paracord lanyard turned out not how I expected, I was happy with how it turned out because for just a little bit I was doing something other than studying. When I was younger I used to color in coloring books, and i got the same peaceful feeling when doing the paracord lanyard. After this, I  went and found my adult coloring book i have and worked on a piece that I’ve been coloring for the last year or so. ',\n",
       " 'Overall, it was something different in a good way because to be absolutely honest I have been stressed with all the school work, exams, and felt at times where I lost all motivation to continue school but through mentor team discussions and activities we have done in the mentor meeting I felt that I could escape from school and anything related to school for a day. A moment to be free in other words and that helped a lot.',\n",
       " 'I have greatly appreciated that we have devoted time as part of our curriculum to focus on health, wellness, and self-care. School, work, and commuting, together, is a tremendous burden and it would be so easy to succumb to the stress of it.  It is helpful as well, that we spend time sharing with our peers during our Group Breakout sessions so that we not only get to know one another better, but also, to share experiences.  Somehow it makes it easier when you realize that you aren’t the only one trying to juggle a bunch of balls at the same time.  If it weren’t for this time being part of what we do in this class, it wouldn’t be the same, and certainly not “as healthy”.  Thank you for being great listeners and wonderful mentors.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care provided me the time to spend with myself without setting aside other extra time from my schedule. From one of my mentor team discussions, I got to research a little bit of information about self-compassion and learned a lot from the readings. Similar to being compassionate to the people we love, self-compassion is about being compassionate to ourselves.',\n",
       " 'In general, the class time devoted to health and wellness has allowed me to step away from school and do something I enjoy then come back refreshed. I think this something that is key and something that I had not done before scholastically because it is often easy to feel burned out if all your doing with every waking hour is studying, reading textbooks, or rewatching lectures. I feel like this time has allowed to be more efficient with the time I have because I can always look forward to that short break that allows me to do what I want and step away from school.  ',\n",
       " 'It has allowed me time to rest and relax without feeling guilty about it. ',\n",
       " 'The class time for mentor team discussions has reminded me the importance of play. In my group, we’ve incorporated various games like Categories and Hotseat. I am currently in a rut emotionally and mentally and starting to embark on a journey to revitalize my motivations and joy. One aspect I want to incorporate into this is enjoyment in play. I had a class in undergrad called the Sociology of Happiness. In one of the modules, it stressed how “play” can lead to happier lives. While there are various avenues such as imaginative play or body play, I hope to actively incorporate this into my schedule and to revitalize my creativity.',\n",
       " 'In the past 3 quarters, class time has given me time to take a breather and relax rather than worrying about school all the time.',\n",
       " 'I was happy in sharing WIP experiences with my team members, and I also tried doing things they recommended in my free time.',\n",
       " 'I really enjoyed this class as there was no stress behind it. We were able to learn relevant topics and tools, while also had some fun during our facilitations. I also appreciated the time allotted for our well-being and the sincere comments made by our professors. I also very much appreciated the transparency of our professors, It definitely made me like I belonged here and am cared for. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'I feel through this class we have connected more. We were able to talk to each other how to take care of our mental wellness, students sharing what they are doing to relive their stress and compassionate communication has improved our ability to communicate by just listening to each other. ',\n",
       " 'Over the past three quarters, the class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care had allowed me to refocus on the aspects of my life that I forgot about that are very comforting and enjoyable. Moreover, getting to communicate with my mentor and team on different topics allowed me to appreciate the little things and see the importance of self-care.',\n",
       " 'It allows me to develop a better self-care and health and wellness. I think the mentor team session was particularly helpful because we actually spent some time doing some fun and short activity that is not related to pharmacy stuff. We have this opportunity to share what we have been through and what strategies we can use to be more successful in studying and balancing between school and work.',\n",
       " 'Class devoted to health and wellness has helped me by not only providing a safe space to express my concerns and stresses, but by also giving me an opportunity to learn how to cope with them in a healthy manner.',\n",
       " 'I appreciate the class time dedicated to health and wellness. It provides incentive to take a break, exercise, practice piano and engage in other activities that I would otherwise feel guilty doing. Whenever I’m not productive, I feel guilt and stress knowing how much studying and other responsibilities I should be working on instead.',\n",
       " \"I'm so grateful to have a class like this where my classmates and I can have a little bit of time to share things and play fun games with each other. School workload and internships have been so much to us; therefore, this class has helped me have time checking in with myself during the week.\",\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has affected me in a positive way. It made me look into myself and evaluate how I am doing and what I really need for myself at that moment. Mentor team discussion was a good session to relax, have some fun, and release some stress and pressures from school work.',\n",
       " 'I have appreciated the time to reflect on health and wellness. I felt that the individual mentor group sessions were the most valuable as they allowed us to form a smaller community and dive deeper. ',\n",
       " 'The weekly emphasis on health and wellness time has been a good reinforcement when feeling stressed and overwhelmed, especially with the reminders that grades are not the defining component of my education here.',\n",
       " 'Having class time devoted to my health and wellness and self-care helped me by forcing myself to take a short break and think about my mental state. This break allowed to look and plan ahead in what I needed to do for that week. The mentor team discussion helped with taking my mind off of pharmacy school and think about other aspect of life. ',\n",
       " 'In general, I do not think that the class time devoted to health and wellness has really done much. I think that the class discussions around it has been good at opening up and normalizing the discussion around mental health and having mental health and wellness as a priority at UW has definitely made the school a healthier and happier place. It’s also really great that Wednesdays are ‘cleared out’ for us to manage our mental health. On the other hand, I haven’t learned anything new in terms of coping skills, communication skills, etc. I think in terms of dealing with my own personal mental health issues, I’ve learned more from therapy, reading, etc.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness has been helpful for me. It has been nice to have that reminder every couple of weeks to slow down and do something to take care of myself. It can be so easy with our busy schedules to forget to take time to relax, but it is so necessary. I really appreciated the mental health first aid session because I think that should be normalized and has the potential to help a lot of people. In many of my mentor team meetings, I was reminded of how important it is to get to know my classmates in a stress-free environment.',\n",
       " 'I appreciate that during the Wednesday asynchronous class we are encouraged to attend to our well-being needs. I have utilized taking naps when I have been exhausted or have not caught up on sleep.',\n",
       " 'Over the past 3 quarters I have tried my best to take advantage of the class time devoted to health, wellness, and self-care, but I still find it very difficult to devote that time for myself. I sometimes feel that I fail to spend my time in a way that positively affects my mental health. During the fall quarter, I found it very easy to devote this time for myself, but during the winter and spring quarter I struggled to maintain this routine. Usually, I would go running around Greenlake, but now I use this time to work closing shifts at my internship. If this continues to be my routine then I will have to find a way to shift my mindset (e.g., see the positive, practice gratitude, etc.) and find time during the other days of the week to work on my health, wellness, and self-care.',\n",
       " 'I cannot emphasize enough how much it has meant to have a dedicated “day off” almost every other week. At bare minimum it has been so nice to have just a class at home that just focuses on tying together all the extra details we have been going through. The WIP rotation, while it’s not super high intensity, is a bit draining sometimes so having the “off week” in between helps a lot to collect and gather my thoughts again. ',\n",
       " 'These past quarters have really helped me take some time out of my day to take care of myself. I didn’t realize the high volume of coursework would affect me in a way where it interfered with daily simple tasks and having a set time to take care of myself or even doing it as homework was really refreshing. ',\n",
       " 'I have really enjoyed having that extra catch up day to myself. It has allowed me to spend more time with my family, study, and even learn a few new recipes. I think some of the mentor team discussions detracted a little from the self-care day as much of the time is interrupted and chopped up into blocks of conversation and the ‘catch-up’ feels a little less productive. The synchronous learning sessions are enjoyable and informative.',\n",
       " 'I think these classes helped me calm down a bit whenever I felt overwhelmed. Just thinking about a different topic gives me a mental break which at first I didn’t think I needed, but it was pretty helpful. This class also helped me critically think about the health of an employee and helped me realize what I do actually want out of a company after I graduate.',\n",
       " 'It has given me a designated time where I focus on my self. If I choose to study during that time for an exam then I do it but most of the time it has helped me set aside a time in the day that is much needed to overall maintain mental wellness. I think it has been an important part of the curriculum as it is easy to forget to take a break. ',\n",
       " 'The most important thing I realized by having the class time devoted to health and wellness over the past 3 quarters was how much the instruction team and UWSOP value their students’ mental health wellness and I truly appreciate that. These dedicated class time allows me to take a deeper breath, relax and think about something different than the heavy course load that us PY1s are facing each quarter, and I can loudly say that this has helped me tremendously in trying to balance my workload and my mental health. ',\n",
       " 'I greatly value all of the time and attention that has been dedicated towards health, wellness, and self-care throughout this course series. I think it’s important that we do whatever we can to spread awareness of mental health illnesses and create a safe space that welcomes these and related topics of discussion. The class time devoted to health and wellness and self-care has inspired me to do the same and has helped me not to be so hard on myself when I feel as though I am underperforming during times I am struggling with my own mental health.',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness as well as self-care allowed me to slow down and take a breath in the middle of a week. It felt relaxing and destressing to know that I have that 2+ hours of class time to finish schoolwork and do something I enjoy. ',\n",
       " 'It is easy for us students to get caught up in all of the school work that is assigned to us and easy for us to forget to focus on ourselves. I really appreciate the emphasis and time that is provided In this class that allows us to focus on our mental health and well being otherwise I don’t think I would have put much attention to taking care of myself mentally. I used to feel guilty if I treated myself to an episode of my show, or going to hangout with my friends knowing that I should be studying, but these assignments remind me that it is important that I am not cooped up studying all day.',\n",
       " 'I’ve become more aware that self-care doesn’t have to be a big event. Just something small throughout the day that addresses your wellness counts as self-care. I also became more aware that although people don’t talk about it a lot to each other, many are going through the same things.',\n",
       " 'I really appreciated the in class time dedicated to mental wellness.  ',\n",
       " 'I found the time devoted to health and wellness rewarding. We tend to focus so much on learning drugs/disease states that we forget patients, who lie in the center of it all. Skills such as compassionate communication is very important as we will be interacting with people in our careers. We need to learn and practice how to effectively interact with them to be competent pharmacists. The self-care session was also worthwhile, it served as a reminder to take time out for ourselves. It was difficult sometimes, especially when other classes got hectic. During these weeks, it was hard to engage completely in the wellness activities but nevertheless I still very much appreciated it. I tend to forget the most basic things when I get stressed about something so these activities helped me step back and reevaluate things. ',\n",
       " 'The class time devoted to health and wellness has given me time at least every other week to think about other aspects of my life outside of my work and school commitments. I enjoyed getting to know about my classmates outside of studying together and it was nice to have more personal contact with the instructors. Sometimes I felt that the mental health and self-care assignments added more stress to my life and not having some of those assignments would have improved my mental health more than having to complete or participate in the session, especially during busier weeks. ',\n",
       " 'I thought that the mentor team discussions were a great way of opening discussions with peers and a faculty member to go through not only academic, but also personal and professional growth. It helped to allow me to hear others opinions and relate to them while also helping each other out with advice and support. ',\n",
       " 'It has helped me feel less guilty about taking time for myself sometime when I am feeling overwhelmed by school. It is nice to check in with my own wellbeing so that I can be there for all the other responsibilities I have.',\n",
       " 'I think class time took up most of my time in the day. If I want to have time for school, internship, my family and friends, I have to scarifies my own time. Sometimes I’m be able to balance them out, sometimes I just feel burnout and shut down. Then I know that I need to give myself time. I think the activities that the teachers gave us is a good reminder to take that time for selfcare. However, as the same time, it feels better to just be busy but have your tasks to be taken care of.',\n",
       " 'It’s great to hear from my peers what they are learning and what they are passionate about.  Otherwise, the class time devoted to health and wellness has helped pulled me back from all the stress that comes from school and life and just sit down and talk about anything.  I think these classes are helpful to remind us to do something for yourself because sometimes you need a reminder to take a break and take care of yourself.',\n",
       " 'Time devoted to health and wellness gave me the opportunity to prioritize my mental health and focus on something not related to school or work. I really struggle setting aside time to do something for myself without being interrupted, and this helped force me to have dedicated self-care time. ',\n",
       " 'It’s been helpful to have open conversations with my Wednesday class group (purple fern). During one of the sessions we discussed financial awareness and preparedness. For example, some students were new to the concept of limiting credit utilization. This is a very important topic for all adults and I wish it was discussed more often.',\n",
       " 'This class time has allowed me to be in touch with my emotions more and understand that going through what I go through is okay because a lot of others are going through the same thing. Also I learned there is no right what to cope with stress and it is okay that way I do it now.',\n",
       " 'It has helped me a lot because it gives me time I need to focus on things I wouldn’t otherwise find time to do. Also, I really enjoyed the mentor group meeting these last two quarter. My peers and I got to know each other very well and it gave us a space to be free and support each other. ',\n",
       " 'The class time dedicated to health and wellness was appreciated and important, but at times felt a bit tedious. I had to take time after finishing my undergraduate to take care of my mental health and develop strategies to handle them, so I understand this is important content for those who didn’t have that opportunity.  ',\n",
       " 'Honestly speaking I feel like although this class is geared toward health and wellness it is still hard to take time for myself and appreciate self-care. Although this spring quarter I have done more self-care than previous quarters, it is still hard. I do really appreciate the time the instructors put into the class and I enjoy the mini group sessions.',\n",
       " 'Gaining some guidance and reassurance from Dr. Chang during my mentor meetings and connecting with my group mates during our mentor team meetings helped me feel more confident in this program. I feel closer to a lot of my classmates are getting many opportunities to work together. From the compassionate communication session, I have learned how to strengthen my interactions with classmates, patients, and preceptors at my internship and WIP site. ',\n",
       " 'I found I formed deeper connections with my friends and classmates when trying to do self-care. I am introverted, but I enjoyed forming those deeper connections and felt more fulfilled afterwards. ',\n",

       " 'Honestly, at first, I think it is unnecessary to have the class time to devote to health and wellness and self-care. However, as time goes by, I realize the importance of this. I spent lots of time studying and forgetting that I also need to take good care of myself as well. Having a class time to devote to health and wellness and self-care reminds me every week that I should at least spend some times to myself, and don’t overwork myself.',\n",
       " 'Mentor team discussions were helpful in that they allowed me to get to know my classmates as well as the instructors better. It is nice to be able to have the time to just come together and talk about whatever is on our minds from test-taking strategies, study tips, WIP experiences, and favorite hobbies. Pharmacy school is very challenging but these sessions are a great reminders to have fun in this program also. ',\n",

From our off site WIP mentor team discussions, I can really feel like myself around others who are going through the same issues as I am. With the words of affirmation as well as understanding that there are several individuals that are readily available to help one another. The extra time we get after class on those days, I am able to practice several activities such as drawing or working out or even catching up on assignments, making me feel productive and happier by the minute.',\n",

Not only that, the time I have taken for myself allowed me to focus on myself and do activities I wouldn’t normally have time for since starting pharmacy school but also, help me manage my mental health.

I realized I need days where I do “nothing” productive and just relax as I do not want to be burnt out. This has a better impact on my mental health this quarter. I feel motivated to study for my midterms. ',\n",

       " 'I was very appreciative that the time to do the activity was built into class time. In this way, it wasn’t really an option to claim that we didn’t have time for self care. Checking in with myself to see how I was taking care of myself always felt nice. ',\n",

I am grateful for the extra time we were given to focus on ourselves and use it in the way we saw fit.  ',\n",

I was able to focus on things that benefited me physically and mentally such as going for a workout or even catching up with some friends. These are simple things that I normally wouldn’t find the time to do but having this extra time to take care of myself has been extremely helpful.',\n",

I am also better at being more aware of when I need some self-care. My skin also feels a little softer too from the skincare routine, which is a nice side effect. ',\n",

For example, I sometime have to choose between taking a 20 minutes nap or go exercise for 20 minutes. It sounds very simple but it has a bit effect to my daily tasks. I feel less focus when I’m lacking of sleep but at the same time my body is tired because I’m sitting to study too much. I always try to keep my health in balance physically and mentally. ',\n",

Complicated and challenging was my normal so I never saw it as complicated or challenging, because it was normal environment. Yet, I worked on myself to get through things as seamlessly as possible. Now, being here in pharmacy school in Seattle, working on my self-care and being removed from what used to be my norm has made me change how I look at challenging life situations that arise. I feel like I am no longer in the storm, rather I am outside looking in. And this has made a world of difference.',\n",

I’m deeply grateful for this activity because I have a time to understand myself more. Sometimes putting my thoughts into words helps me to clear my mind out and clarity comes back. After writing down everything in my mind, I feel like my thoughts lose the ability to take control my mind and stop bothering me. Looking at the words I write is like looking inside myself sometimes. Keeping those words and reading them will help remind me of who I am. ',\n",

It is something I use to maintain my mental health, and I find that I am less stressed and much more efficient when it comes to studying when I engage in my activities. Even if it’s only a 20 minute walk outside, my self-care routine keeps me sane during school.  During this year, it was nice to have reminders to prioritize self-care and helped keep any guilt I sometimes feel for taking time away from work/school away. ',\n",
       " 'For the most part, it helped a bit especially on weeks that we have a lot on our plates. Such as, this week for example where I had capstone, in-service for WIP, assignments due within the week, and exam Friday. Though weeks like this I tend to self-care a lot more than on our “off” easy weeks. In conclusion, I would have to say the choices that I decided is what is keeping me going through pharmacy school.',\n",
       " 'Self-care is generally what goes out the window for me first when I am under time pressure.  As an example:  I don’t have time to work out.  It’s a choice, but a strange one for me because I’ve always been dedicated to doing so.  I feel very stressed each week because as an older student, I must spend countless hours with subjects like Med Chem, so my free time choices rarely happen.  By having a reminder, an opportunity to focus on self-care, it suddenly becomes something viable.  It doesn’t have to be hours- just 15 or 20 minutes, and it makes a huge difference in my clarity, outlook, and happiness.  ',\n",

       " 'This time dedicated to self-care helped me think about self-care in a different perspective. I hope to incorporate self-care as a scheduled necessity rather than a last ditch effort to preserve some sanity. I hope to view self-care as fuel to take care of myself so that I am fully invigorated to accomplish my goals rather than a pitstop when I’m only running low.',\n",

       " 'The time I spent helped me relax and concentrate more when I am studying.',\n",
       " 'It made me feel more motivated and pushed me to work harder. Having those you care around you is very important and you always want to make them proud.',\n",
       " 'It was very helpful as it gave me an opportunity to take a break from pharmacy and enjoy activities that I like. I also find it helpful when I am stuck in a concept that I find difficult to understand, taking 20-30 minutes break and refreshing the mind was important.',\n",
